# PRMs-for-Socratic-Teacher-Feedback-Data-Creation

This project creates a reward model to train language models (LLMs) to provide effective Socratic-style feedback, encouraging students to actively reason and solve problems independently.

## Motivation
Effective teaching should guide students without directly providing solutions, aligning with Socratic principles to foster independent reasoning.

## Project Overview
- Generate feedback that helps students actively engage and reason through problems.
- Balance guidance so it supports high-ability students without overly assisting lower-ability students.
- Evaluate the quality and effectiveness of generated feedback against Socratic teaching standards.

## Setup

### Virtual Environment
Set up the project using Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv socratic-env
source socratic-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project
Further details on running experiments and evaluations will be provided in subsequent documentation.
