    "teacher_raw_output": "To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between the speed of sound, the frequency of the first overtone, and the fundamental frequency of an open organ pipe.\n\nFor an open organ pipe, the first overtone is an odd harmonic, which is the third harmonic (3f) in this case. The relationship between the frequency of the first overtone (N1) and the fundamental frequency (f) is:\n\nN1 = 3f\n\nGiven that N1 = 512 Hz, we can solve for f:\n\nf = N1 / 3\nf = 512 / 3\nf = 170.67 Hz\n\nNow, when the pipe is blown with hydrogen, the speed of sound changes from V = 340 m/sec to V' = 1200 m/sec. The fundamental frequency (f) is directly proportional to the speed of sound (V). Therefore, we can write:\n\nf' = f * (V' / V)\n\nwhere f' is the new fundamental frequency.\n\nf' = 170.67 * (1200 / 340)\nf' = 170.67 * 3.529\nf' \u2248 603.21 Hz\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.

We also know that the first overtone is the third harmonic, so we can write:\n\nN1 = 3f\nf = N1 / 3\nf = 512 / 3\nf = 170.67 Hz\n\nHowever, we also know that the fundamental frequency in air is f, and the first overtone in air is 3f. We are given that the speed of sound in hydrogen is 1200 m/sec. We can use the relationship:\n\nN1 = 3f\nN1' = 3f'\n\nwhere N1' is the first overtone in hydrogen.\n\nSince the speed of sound in hydrogen is 1200 m/sec, and we know that N1 is the first overtone in air, we can write:\n\nN1 = 3f\nN1 = 3 * (512 / 3)\nN1 = 3 * 170.67\nN1 = 512 Hz\n\nWe are given that the first overtone in",

    "teacher_raw_output": "To find the capacity of the tank, we need to determine the combined rate at which the two inlet pipes fill the tank and the rate at which the leak empties the tank.\n\nFirst, let's find the rate at which the leak empties the tank. Since the leak can empty the full tank in 3 hours, we can calculate the rate of the leak per hour. \n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so the rate of the leak per minute is 1/3 * 60 = 20 litres per minute.\n\nNext, let's find the combined rate at which the two inlet pipes fill the tank. Inlet Pipe A fills at a rate of 6 litres per minute, and Inlet Pipe B fills at a rate of 4 litres per minute. So, the combined rate is 6 + 4 = 10 litres per minute.\n\nSince the tank is emptied in 12 hours when both pipes are opened, we can calculate the net rate at which the tank is being emptied per hour. \n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so the net rate of the leak per hour is 20 litres per minute * 60 minutes = 1200 litres per hour.\n\nHowever, the combined rate of the two inlet pipes is 10 litres per minute * 60 minutes = 600 litres per hour.\n\nSince the tank is being emptied, the net rate is the difference between the leak rate and the combined inlet pipe rate, which is 1200 - 600 = 600 litres per hour.\n\nHowever, the tank is actually being filled and then emptied, so the net rate is actually 600 + 600 = 1200 litres per hour. \n\nBut we have to take into account that the tank is being filled at a rate of 600 litres per hour and then emptied at a rate of 1200 litres per hour. This means that the tank is actually being emptied at a net rate of 600 litres per hour.\n\nWe can use the formula: \n\nCombined Inlet Pipe Rate - Leak Rate = Net Rate of Tank Emptying \n\nWe can write this as an equation, with the combined inlet pipe rate being 600 litres per hour and the net rate of tank emptying being 600 litres per hour.\n\n600 - Leak Rate = 600\n\nLeak Rate = 0\n\nHowever, this is incorrect.

The power of x in the first term is 1/2, and the power of x in the second term is -1/4.\n\nFor the constant term, the powers of x must add up to 0. Since we are expanding to the 6th power, we can use the binomial theorem to find the term where the powers of x cancel out.\n\nThe binomial theorem states that the nth term of the expansion of (a + b)^n is given by:\n\nT_n = nC_r * a^(n-r) * b^r\n\nwhere nC_r is the binomial coefficient, and r is the term number.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the term where the powers of x cancel out, so we need to find the value of r that makes the power of x equal to 0.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the power of x in the nth term is given by:\n\nPower of x = (n-r) * (1/2) + r * (-1/4)\n\nWe want to find the value of r that makes the power of x equal to 0.

We know that W + S = 12 (since there are 12 cups of each type) and that the total amount of coffee used is 36 tablespoons.\n\nFor weak coffee, Taylor uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water, so the total amount of coffee used for weak coffee is W. For strong coffee, the amount of coffee used per cup is unknown, so let's call it x. The total amount of coffee used for strong coffee is then Sx.\n\nWe can set up an equation based on the total amount of coffee used: W + Sx = 36.\n\nSince W + S = 12, we can substitute this into the previous equation: 12 + Sx = 36.\n\nNow, we can solve for Sx: Sx = 36 - 12 = 24.\n\nWe know that S + W = 12, and we also know that Sx = 24. We can find the ratio of strong coffee to weak coffee by dividing Sx by W.\n\nFirst, we need to find W. Since S + W = 12 and Sx = 24, we can write S + (24/S) = 12. Multiply both sides by S to get S^2 + 24 = 12S. Then, rearrange the equation into a quadratic equation: S^2 - 12S + 24 = 0.\n\nNow, factor the quadratic equation: (S - 6)(S - 4) = 0.\n\nSolve for S: S = 6 or S = 4.\n\nSince S + W = 12, we can find W: W = 12 - S.

If the average mileage for the entire trip was 55 miles per gallon, what was the total length of the trip in miles? Express your answer as a whole number.",
    "ground_truth_answer": "440",
    "teacher_raw_output": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of weighted averages. Let's denote the total length of the trip as 'x' miles.\n\nSince the car ran exclusively on its battery for the first 40 miles, it didn't use any gasoline for those miles. Therefore, the amount of gasoline used for the rest of the trip is (x - 40) gallons.\n\nThe car used gasoline at a rate of 0.02 gallons per mile, so the total amount of gasoline used for the entire trip is 0.02x gallons.\n\nWe know that the average mileage for the entire trip was 55 miles per gallon, so we can set up the equation:\n\n(x - 40) / 0.02 = 0.02x / 55\n\nTo solve this equation, we can start by cross-multiplying:\n\n55(x - 40) = 0.02x\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\n55x - 2200 = 0.02x\n\nSubtracting 0.02x from both sides:\n\n54.98x - 2200 = 0\n\nAdding 2200 to both sides:\n\n54.98x = 2200\n\nDividing both sides by 54.98:\n\nx = 2200 / 54.98\n\nx \u2248 40\n\nHowever, this is incorrect as we are told that the answer is 440.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem. We know that the car ran for the first 40 miles on battery, and then used gasoline for the rest of the trip. The average mileage for the entire trip was 55 miles per gallon.\n\nLet's denote the total length of the trip as 'x' miles. The amount of gasoline used for the entire trip is 0.02x gallons.\n\nThe amount of gasoline used for the first 40 miles is 0, since the car ran on battery. The amount of gasoline used for the rest of the trip is (x - 40) - 40 = x - 80 gallons.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n(x - 80) / (x - 40) = 55\n\nTo solve this equation, we can cross-multiply:\n\nx - 80 = 55(x - 40)\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\nx - 80 = 55x - 2200\n\nSubtracting x from both sides:\n\n-80 = 54.98x - 2200\n\nAdding 2200 to both sides:\n\n-80 +",

However, we know that 3 spools of yarn are required to make one beret, so we need to divide 60 by 3 to get the total number of berets James can make.\n\n60 / 3 = 20 \n\nHowever, the solution is 11, which suggests that there must be a specific combination of yarns that James can use to make a set of berets. \n\nUpon closer inspection, we can see that James can use 12 spools of red, 3 spools of black, and 0 spools of blue to make a set of berets, as this combination meets the LCM requirement. \n\nHowever, James also has 6 spools of blue yarn. Since he has 6 spools of blue yarn, he can also use 6 spools of blue yarn, 12 spools of red yarn, and 0 spools of black yarn to make a set of berets. \n\nBut what about the remaining yarns? We can use 15 spools of black yarn and 6 spools of blue yarn to make a set of berets, but we will be left with 9 spools of red yarn.\n\nUsing 12 spools of red yarn and 3 spools of black yarn, we will be left with 9 spools of red yarn and 12 spools of blue yarn.
