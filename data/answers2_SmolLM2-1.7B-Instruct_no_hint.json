      "1. Let's denote the given right trapezoid as $ABCD$ with bases $AB$ and $CD$ and lateral sides $BC$ and $AD$. The trapezoid is divided into two smaller trapezoids by a line parallel to the bases, which we will call $AEB$ and $CDF$ for simplicity.\n\n2. Consider the smaller trapezoid $ABE$. This trapezoid is similar to the larger trapezoid $ABCD$ because they share the same angle at $A$ (the angle between the bases $AB$ and $CD$), and the corresponding angles at $B$ and $D$ are equal.\n\n3. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar trapezoids is equal to the ratio of their bases. Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{BE}{BC} = \\frac{AE}{AD}\n   \\]\n\n4. Since $BE$ and $BC$ are the bases of the smaller trapezoid $ABE$, and $AE$ and $AD$ are the bases of the larger trapezoid $ABCD$, we can express the ratio of their bases as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{AE}{AD} = \\frac{c}{d}\n   \\]\n\n5. Substituting this ratio into our previous equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{BE}{BC} = \\frac{c}{d}\n   \\]\n\n6. Since $BE$ and $BC$ are equal, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{c}{d} = 1\n   \\]\n\n7. Solving for $c$ in terms of $d$, we find:\n   \\[\n   c = d\n   \\]\n\n8. Given the problem conditions, we know that $c<d$. Therefore, the only solution is $c=d$.\n\n9. In conclusion, the bases of the original trapezoid are equal, and the only possible ratio of their bases is $1:1$. Thus, the final answer is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1:1}\n  ",
      "1. Let the bases of the trapezoid be $c$ and $d$.\n2. The line parallel to the bases splits the trapezoid into two trapezoids, each with a circle inscribed.\n3. Let the smaller trapezoids have bases $b_1$ and $b_2$.\n4. Since the trapezoids are similar, we can set up the proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b_1}{b_2} = \\frac{c}{d}\n   \\]\n5. Let $b_1$ be the base of the smaller trapezoid. The height of the trapezoid is the distance between the bases, which is $d - b_1$.\n6. The radius of the inscribed circle in the smaller trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)$.\n7. The radius of the inscribed circle in the larger trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}(c + d)$.\n8. We know that the sum of the radii of the circles in the smaller trapezoid equals the radius of the circle in the larger trapezoid:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(c + d)\n   \\]\n9. Solving for $b_1 + b_2$, we get:\n   \\[\n   b_1 + b_2 = c + d\n   \\]\n10. Substituting $b_1$ from the proportion into the equation for $b_1 + b_2$, we get:\n    \\[\n    b_1 + b_2 = \\frac{c}{d} \\cdot b_1 + b_1\n    \\]\n11. Solving for $b_1$, we get:\n    \\[\n    b_1 = \\frac{c}{d + 1}\n    \\]\n12. Substituting $b_1$ back into the equation for $b_1 + b_2$, we get:\n    \\[\n    b_1 + b_2 = \\frac{c}{d + 1} + b_1\n    \\]\n13. Simplifying, we get:\n    \\[\n    b_2 = \\frac{c}{d + 1}\n    \\]\n14. Substituting $b_1$ and $b_2$ back into the proportion, we get:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{b_1}{b_2} = \\frac{\\frac{c}{d + 1}}{\\frac{c}{d}}\n    \\]\n15.

      "1. Let's consider the given right trapezoid with bases $a$ and $b$, and the height $h$.\n\n2. The line parallel to the bases of the trapezoid splits it into two smaller trapezoids, each of which can have a circle inscribed in it. Let's denote the bases of the smaller trapezoids as $x$ and $y$.\n\n3. Since the line parallel to the bases of the trapezoid splits it into two smaller trapezoids, the line is also parallel to the bases of the smaller trapezoids. Therefore, the heights of the smaller trapezoids are equal, which means $x$ is equal to $y$.\n\n4. The bases of the smaller trapezoids are $x$ and $y$. The total height of the trapezoid is $h$. So, the total height of the larger trapezoid is $2h$.\n\n5. The line parallel to the bases of the trapezoid also splits the larger trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids. Therefore, the total height of the larger trapezoid is the sum of the heights of the smaller trapezoids, which is $2x + 2y = h$.\n\n6. Since the bases of the smaller trapezoids are $x$ and $y$, the sum of the bases of the smaller trapezoids is $x + y$. Therefore, the total length of the bases of the larger trapezoid is $x + y + x + y = 2x + 2y = h$.\n\n7. The ratio of the bases of the smaller trapezoids to the larger trapezoid is $x:h$ to $y:h$. This means $x = kx$ and $y = kh$, where $k$ is the common ratio.\n\n8. We can express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $a$ and $b$ as $x = \\frac{a}{k}$ and $y = \\frac{b}{k}$.\n\n9. Since the bases of the smaller trapezoids are $x$ and $y$, the total length of the bases of the larger trapezoid is $x + y + x + y = 2x + 2y = h$. Substituting $x$ and $y$, we get $2\\left(\\frac{a}{k}\\right) + 2\\left(\\frac{b}{k}\\right) = h$.\n\n10. Simplifying the equation, we get $\\frac{2a}{k} + \\frac{2b}{k} = h$. Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get $2a + 2b = kh$.\n\n11. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $a + b = \\frac{k}{2}h$. Since $c<d$, we know that $a + b = c + d$.\n\n12. Therefore, we have $c + d = \\frac{k}{2}h$.\n\n13. Solving for $h$, we get $h = 2\\left(c + d\\right)$.\n\n14. Substituting $h$ back into the equation $2a + 2b = kh$, we get $2a + 2b = 2\\left(c + d\\right)k$.\n\n15. Simplifying the equation, we get $a + b = c + d$.\n\n16. Finally, we can conclude that the bases of the original trapezoid are $c$ and $d$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{c \\text{ and } d}$.",
      "Let's reason through this problem step by step:\n\n1. Consider the right trapezoid with bases $c$ and $d$. The line parallel to the bases splits the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids, each of which can have a circle inscribed in it.\n\n2. The smaller trapezoids can be thought of as half of the original trapezoid. Therefore, the bases of the smaller trapezoids are equal to half of the original bases, which are $c/2$ and $d/2$.\n\n3. Since the line parallel to the bases splits the trapezoid into two equal smaller trapezoids, the line is also the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the centers of the inscribed circles in the smaller trapezoids.\n\n4. The distance between the centers of the inscribed circles in the smaller trapezoids is equal to the sum of the lengths of the bases of the smaller trapezoids, which is $c + d/2$.\n\n5. We know that the line parallel to the bases of the original trapezoid is also perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the inscribed circles in the smaller trapezoids.\n\n6. Since the line is also perpendicular to the bases of the original trapezoid, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the bases of the original trapezoid.\n\n7. Let $x$ be the length of the bases of the original trapezoid. Then, the height of the original trapezoid is $c - x$.\n\n8. Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right trapezoid, we have:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + (c - x)^2 = (c + d/2)^2\n   \\]\n\n9. Expanding the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + c^2 - 2cx + x^2 = c^2 + d^2/4 + c^2/2 - cd/2\n   \\]\n\n10. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n    \\[\n    2x^2 - 2cx + x^2 = d^2/4 - cd/2\n    \\]\n\n11. Combining like terms, we get:\n    \\[\n    3x^2 - 2cx - cd/2 = d^2/4\n    \\]\n\n12. Solving for $x$, we get:\n    \\[\n    3x^2 - 2cx - cd/2 + d^2/4 = 0\n    \\]\n\n13. Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:\n    \\[\n    12x^2 - 8cx - 2cd + d^2 = 0\n    \\]\n\n14. Solving the quadratic equation, we get:\n    \\[\n    x = \\frac{4c \\pm \\sqrt{16c^2 + 48cd + 16d^2}}{24}\n    \\]\n\n15. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n    \\[\n    x = \\frac{c \\pm \\sqrt{4c^2 + 4cd + d^2}}{6}\n    \\]\n\n16. Since $c<d$, we take the negative root:\n    \\[\n    x = \\frac{c - \\sqrt{4c^2 + 4cd + d^2}}{6}\n    \\]\n\n17. Simplifying further, we get:\n    \\[\n    x = \\frac{c - \\sqrt{(2c)^2 + (2c)d + d^2}}{6}\n    \\]\n\n18. Since $x$ is a length, we can discard the negative root.\n\n19. Therefore, the bases of the original trapezoid are:\n    \\[\n    x = \\frac{c - \\sqrt{(2c)^2 + (2c)d + d^2}}{6}\n    \\]\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = \\frac{c - \\sqrt{(2c)^2 + (2c)d + d^2}}{6}}\n\\]",
      "1. Let's consider the given right trapezoid, which we'll call \\(ABCD\\) with \\(AB \\parallel CD\\) and \\(AB = c\\), \\(CD = d\\).\n\n2. The line parallel to the bases splits the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids, each of which can have a circle inscribed in it. Let's call the smaller trapezoids \\(ABFG\\) and \\(CDHK\\).\n\n3. Since the line is parallel to the bases, the triangles \\(ABF\\) and \\(CDK\\) are similar. This means that the corresponding angles are equal.\n\n4. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of their corresponding angles. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:\n\\[\n\\frac{AF}{CD} = \\frac{BF}{HK} = \\frac{AB}{CD} = \\frac{c}{d}\n\\]\n\n5. We know that the radius of the inscribed circle in the smaller trapezoid \\(ABFG\\) is equal to half the height of the trapezoid minus the radius of the inscribed circle in the larger trapezoid \\(CDHK\\). Let's denote the height of the trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) as \\(h\\).\n\n6. The height \\(h\\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\nh^2 = (c - d)^2 - (c - d)^2 + c^2 - d^2\n\\]\n\n7. Solving for \\(h\\):\n\\[\nh^2 = 2(c^2 - d^2)\n\\]\n\n8. The radius of the inscribed circle in \\(ABFG\\) is \\(r_1\\) and the radius of the inscribed circle in \\(CDHK\\) is \\(r_2\\).

Finally, we can find the bases \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) of the original trapezoid:\n\\[\nc + d = \\frac{2h}{2} = h\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{h}\n\\]"

Since \\(BD = 12\\), triangle \\(BDC\\) is also a right triangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \\(BDC\\):\n   \\[\n   BD^2 + BC^2 = CD^2\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the known values:\n   \\[\n   12^2 + BC^2 = CD^2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   144 + BC^2 = CD^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   BC^2 = CD^2 - 144\n   \\]\n\n7. Now we have two equations involving \\(AC\\):\n   \\[\n   AC^2 = \\sqrt{313}^2 + \\left(\\frac{AC}{2}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   AC^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{313} + \\frac{AC}{2}\\right)^2 - 144\n   \\]\n\n8.

From the first equation, we have:\n   \\[\n   AC^2 = 313 + \\frac{1}{2}AC^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2}AC^2 - AC^2 = 313\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{1}{2}AC^2 = 313\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   AC^2 = -626\n   \\]\n   This is not possible, as the area of a triangle cannot be negative.\n\n10. The given problem has a contradiction due to the incorrect calculation or the triangle being invalid.

First, we note that the equation is an equation involving a function of x (2^x) and an integer (2[x]). We can't simply solve the equation by substituting different values of x.

      "Let's denote the original price of the car as P and the discount percentage as D.\n\nThe trader bought the car at a discount, so he paid (100 - D)% of the original price. Let's denote this amount as B.\n\nThe trader sold the car at a 100% increase on the price he bought it. This means the selling price is equal to the original price plus the increase. Let's denote the selling price as S.\n\nS = B + (100% of B) = B + B = 2B\n\nThe trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price. This means that the selling price is 160.00000000000001% of the original price. So, we have:\n\n2B = 160.00000000000001% of P\n\nTo find the discount percentage (D), we need to find the percentage of the original price that B represents. We can do this by dividing B by the original price and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage:\n\nD = (B / P) * 100\n\nSubstituting the value of B from the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n\nD = (2B / P) * 100\n\nSubstituting the value of B from the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n\nD = (2 * (B + B) / P) * 100\n\nSubstituting the value of B from the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n\nD = (2 * (2B) / P) * 100\n\nD = (4B / P) * 100\n\nD = (4 * 160.00000000000001% of P) / P\n\nD = (4 * 160.00000000000001) / 100\n\nD = 640.00000000000004 / 100\n\nD = 6.4000000000000004%\n\nSo, the discount percentage on the original price when he bought the car was $\\boxed{6.4000000000000004\\%}$ .",
      "Step 1: Let's assume the original price of the car is P.\n\nStep 2: The trader made a 60.00000000000001% profit on the original price, so his selling price is P + (60.00000000000001% of P).\n\nStep 3: The trader sold the car at a 100% increase on the price he bought it, so his selling price is twice the original price: 2P.\n\nStep 4: The selling price of 2P is equal to the profit on the original price plus the original price: 2P = P + (60.00000000000001% of P).\n\nStep 5: Now we can solve for P. First, convert the percentage to a decimal: 60.00000000000001% = 60.00000000000001 / 100 = 0.6000000000000001.\n\nStep 6: Now, we can set up the equation: 2P = P + 0.6000000000000001P.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation: 2P = 1.6000000000000001P.\n\nStep 8: Subtract P from both sides: P = 0.6000000000000001P.\n\nStep 9: Divide both sides by P: 1 = 0.6000000000000001.\n\nStep 10: The result is a contradiction because 1 is not equal to 0.6000000000000001. This indicates that the original assumption that the trader bought the car at a certain discount on its original price is incorrect.\n\nStep 11: Therefore, the discount percentage on the original price when he bought the car is $\\boxed{0\\%}$ .",
      "Step 1: Let's assume the original price of the car is P.\n\nStep 2: The trader made a 60.00000000000001% profit on the original price. This means that the selling price (SP) is 160.00000000000002% above the original price (P).\n\nStep 3: Let's denote the discount percentage as D%. This means that the price the trader paid (PP) is (100 - D)% of the original price (P).\n\nStep 4: According to the given information, the selling price (SP) is 100% more than the price the trader paid (PP). Therefore, SP = PP + 100% of PP.\n\nStep 5: We can express this mathematically as:\nSP = PP + 0.50 * PP\n\nStep 6: Since SP is 160.00000000000002% above the original price (P), we can write:\nSP = P + 160.00000000000002% of P\n\nStep 7: Since SP = PP + 0.50 * PP, we can equate the two expressions for SP:\nP + 160.00000000000002% of P = PP + 0.50 * PP\n\nStep 8: Simplify the equation:\nP + 160.00000000000002% of P = PP + 0.50 * PP\nP + 160.00000000000002% of P = 1.50 * PP\n\nStep 9: Now, we know that PP is (100 - D)% of P. So, we can express PP as:\nPP = (100 - D)% of P\n\nStep 10: Substitute PP in the equation from step 8:\nP + 160.00000000000002% of P = 1.50 * (100 - D)% of P\n\nStep 11: Simplify the equation:\nP + 160.00000000000002% of P = 150 - 1.50 * D% of P\n\nStep 12: Now, let's isolate P on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 150 from both sides:\nP - 150 + 160.00000000000002% of P = -1.50 * D% of P\n\nStep 13: Simplify the equation:\nP - 150 + 160.00000000000002% of P = -1.50 * D% of P\nP - 150 + 160.00000000000002% of P = -0.50 * D% of P\n\nStep 14: Now, we can factor out P from the right side of the equation:\nP * (1 - 150/P + 160.00000000000002%) = -0.50 * D% of P\n\nStep 15: Since P is the original price and it's not zero, we can cancel P from both sides:\n1 - 150/P + 160.00000000000002% = -0.50 * D%\n\nStep 16: Now, let's solve for D%:\n1 - 150/P + 160.00000000000002% = -0.50 * D%\n1 - 150/P + 160.00000000000002% = -0.50 * D%\n\nStep 17: Rearrange the equation to solve for D%:\n0.50 * D% = 1 - 150/P + 160.00000000000002% - ",
      "Step 1: Let's denote the original price of the car as P.\n\nStep 2: The trader bought the car at a certain discount, so the price he paid for the car is P - D, where D is the discount percentage.\n\nStep 3: The trader sold the car at a 100% increase on the price he bought it, which means the selling price is P + P = 2P.\n\nStep 4: The trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price, so the profit is 60.00000000000001% of P.\n\nStep 5: The profit can also be expressed as the difference between the selling price and the price he bought it for, which is 2P - P = P.\n\nStep 6: Since the profit is also the difference between the selling price and the original price, we can write the equation as:\n\nP = 2P - D\n\nStep 7: Solving for D, we get:\n\nD = P - 2P\n\nStep 8: Simplifying the equation, we get:\n\nD = -P\n\nStep 9: The negative sign indicates that the discount is on the original price.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the discount percentage on the original price when he bought the car is -100%.",
      "Step 1: Let's denote the original price of the car as P.\n\nStep 2: The trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price. Therefore, the profit he made is 0.6000000000000001 * P.\n\nStep 3: The trader sold the car at a 100% increase on the price he bought it. This means the selling price (S) is equal to the price he bought it (P) plus 100% of the price he bought it. So, S = P + 0.50 * P = 1.50 * P.\n\nStep 4: The profit made on the selling price is the selling price minus the original price. This profit is 1.50 * P - P = 0.50 * P.\n\nStep 5: We know that the profit is 0.6000000000000001 * P, so we can set the profit from the selling price equal to the profit from the buying price: 0.50 * P = 0.6000000000000001 * P.\n\nStep 6: Now, we can solve for the discount percentage. To do this, we subtract the selling price from the original price, then divide that by the original price: (P - S) / P = (P - 1.50 * P) / P = (0.50 * P) / P = 0.50.\n\nStep 7: To express the discount percentage, we multiply the result by 100: 0.50 * 100 = 50%.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the discount percentage on the original price when the trader bought the car was 50%.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{50}"

      "1. First, we recognize that the terms $a_1$, $a_3$, and $a_9$ form a geometric sequence. This implies that the square of the middle term is equal to the product of the other two terms.

Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{\\pi}2 (\\sin x + \\cos x)$.\n\nStep 5: Find the solutions within the interval.\nTo find the solutions within the interval $[0, \\pi]$, we need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x = \\frac{\\pi}2 (\\sin x + \\cos x)$ within this interval.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the values of $x$ within the interval.\nUsing numerical methods or graphing the functions, we find that the solutions to the equation $x = \\frac{\\pi}2 (\\sin x + \\cos x)$ within the interval $[0, \\pi]$ are $x = \\frac{\\pi}2$ and $x = \\frac{3\\pi}2$.\n\nStep 7: Count the number of solutions.\nThere are two solutions within the interval $[0, \\pi]$.\n\nFinal Answer: The equation $\\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}2 \\cos x\\right)=\\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}2 \\sin x\\right)$ has $\\boxed{2}$ solutions in the closed interval $[0,\\pi]$."

      "1. Let's denote the original price of gasoline as P and the original quantity of gasoline bought as Q. Therefore, the total original cost of gasoline is P * Q.\n\n2. The driver intends to spend 10% more on gasoline, which means the new price of gasoline will be P + 0.10P = 1.10P.\n\n3. The driver also intends to buy the same quantity of gasoline (Q), but now with a 12% reduction in the price, so the new price per unit of gasoline will be P * Q / Q = P * 0.88 (since Q is not changing).\n\n4. According to the problem, the new price per unit of gasoline is 1.10P * 0.88 = P * 1.00P.\n\n5. To find the percentage increase in the price of gasoline, we divide the new price by the original price and subtract 1: (1.00P / P) - 1 = 0.00P - 1 = -1%.\n\n6. Therefore, the percentage increase in the price of gasoline is -1%. This means the price of gasoline has decreased by 1%.",
      "Step 1: Let's assume the original price of gasoline is P dollars per gallon. The driver originally buys x gallons of gasoline.\n\nStep 2: The driver intends to spend 10% more on gasoline. So, the new price of gasoline will be P + 0.10P = 1.10P dollars per gallon.\n\nStep 3: The driver plans to buy 12% less gasoline. Therefore, the new quantity of gasoline that the driver should buy is 0.88x gallons.\n\nStep 4: The new quantity of gasoline (0.88x) should be proportional to the new price of gasoline (1.10P).

The new selling price would then be P + 15% of P.\n\nStep 4: The new selling price is given as $1250 + $500 = $1750.\n\nStep 5: We can set up the equation for the new selling price:\n\n$1750 = P + 0.15P\n\nStep 6: Simplify the equation:\n\n$1750 = 1.15P\n\nStep 7: Solve for P:\n\nP = $1750 / 1.15\n\nStep 8: Calculate P:\n\nP = $1500\n\nStep 9: The cost price of the article is given as $1250.\n\nStep 10: Calculate the loss:\n\nLoss = Cost Price - Selling Price\nLoss = $1250 - $1500\nLoss = -$250\n\nStep 11: Since the loss is negative, it means the article was initially sold at a loss.\n\nStep 12: Calculate the loss percentage:\n\nLoss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) * 100\nLoss Percentage = (-$250 / $1250) * 100\nLoss Percentage = -20%\n\nStep 13: Since the loss percentage is negative, it means there was no loss when the article was initially sold.\n\nFinal Answer: The loss percentage when the article was initially sold is $\\boxed{0\\%}$ .",
      "Step 1: Calculate the original selling price.\nSince a $500 increase in selling price would lead to a 15% profit, we can calculate the original selling price by dividing the gain by the gain percentage and then adding the original selling price.\n\nThe gain is the profit per dollar, so if a $500 increase would lead to a 15% profit, then the original selling price (SP) is:\n\nSP = $500 + (15% of $500)\nSP = $500 + (0.15 * $500)\nSP = $500 + $75\nSP = $575\n\nStep 2: Calculate the loss percentage.\nNow, we know the cost price (CP) of the article is $1250 and the original selling price (SP) is $575. To find the loss, we subtract the cost price from the selling price.\n\nLoss = SP - CP\nLoss = $575 - $1250\nLoss = -$675\n\nThis is a loss of $675. To find the loss percentage, we divide the loss by the cost price and multiply by 100.\n\nLoss Percentage = (Loss / CP) * 100\nLoss Percentage = (-$675 / $1250) * 100\nLoss Percentage = (-0.55) * 100\nLoss Percentage = -55%\n\nThe loss percentage when the article was initially sold is -55%."

      "1. Given that $\\mathbf{a}$ is parallel to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, we can express $\\mathbf{a}$ as $\\mathbf{a} = k \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, where $k$ is a scalar.\n2. We know that $\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ -3 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix}$. Substituting the expression for $\\mathbf{a}$, we get:\n\\[k \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ -3 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n3. To find $\\mathbf{b}$, we need to isolate $\\mathbf{b}$ on the left-hand side of the equation.

Since $\\mathbf{b}$ is orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, their dot product must be zero. The dot product of two vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ a_3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\end{pmatrix}$ is given by $a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3$. Thus, we have:\n\\[6 - k + (-3) + k - 6 - k = 0\\]\n6. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n\\[0 = 0\\]\n\nSince the equation simplifies to 0, which is true for any value of $k$, there are infinitely many solutions for $\\mathbf{b}$. Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$.",
      "1. Let $\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}$. We are given that $\\mathbf{a}$ is parallel to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, so the components of $\\mathbf{a}$ must be proportional to the components of $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.

We know that $\\mathbf{b}$ is orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Since $\\mathbf{a}$ is parallel to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\mathbf{b}$ must be orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ as well.

This means the customer did not pay any interest.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the percentage of the purchase price paid in interest.\nNow, we need to calculate the percentage of the purchase price paid in interest.\nPercentage paid in interest = (Interest / Purchase price) * 100\nPercentage paid in interest = (-$20 / $110) * 100\nPercentage paid in interest = -0.1818 * 100\nPercentage paid in interest = -18.18%\n\nSince the percentage cannot be negative, it means that the customer did not pay any interest.\n\nFinal Answer: The customer paid 0% of the purchase price in interest.",
      "Step 1: Calculate the total amount paid by the customer using the payment plan.\n\nThe customer makes 12 monthly payments of $10 each, so the total amount paid is:\n12 * $10 = $120\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total amount paid including the $10 down payment.\n\nThe total amount paid, including the down payment, is $110.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the amount of interest paid.\n\nThe interest paid is the total amount paid minus the total amount paid including the down payment:\n$110 - $120 = -$10\n\nHowever, since the customer paid $100 more than the total amount paid including the down payment, this indicates that the customer actually paid $10 less in interest than the down payment.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the percentage of the purchase price that the customer paid in interest.\n\nTo find the percentage of the purchase price paid in interest, divide the interest paid by the total amount paid including the down payment and multiply by 100:\n(-$10 / $120) * 100 = -8.33%\n\nSince the negative sign indicates that the customer paid more in interest than the down payment, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{-8.33\\%}"
