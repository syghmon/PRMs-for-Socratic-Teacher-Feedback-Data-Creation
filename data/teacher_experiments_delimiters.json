Since for every pencil you buy, you must buy 2 erasers, the store sold 20 * 2 = 40 erasers.\n3. Since the erasers cost $1 each, the total cost of erasers is 40 * $1 = $40.\n4. The problem states that the erasers cost 1/2 the price of the pencils. Let's call the price of a pencil 'x'. Then, the price of an eraser is x/2.\n5. We know that the total cost of erasers is $40, so we can set up the equation 40 * (x/2) = $40.\n6. Simplifying the equation, we get 20x = $40.\n7. Dividing both sides by 20, we get x = $2, which is the price of a pencil.\n8. The total cost of pencils is 20 * $2 = $40.\n9. To find the total amount the store earned, we add the total cost of pencils and erasers: $40 + $40 = $80.\n\nHowever, the store earned $120, which means the problem must be asking for the total revenue, not just the total cost. The revenue is the total amount earned, which is the total cost plus the total profit. Since the profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost, we can set up the equation: revenue = cost + profit.\n\n<hint> The price of the pencils and the cost of the erasers are given, but the store is selling both pencils and erasers, so the total revenue is the sum of the revenue from pencils and the revenue from erasers. </hint>\n\nLet's continue solving the problem:\n\nThe revenue from pencils is the number of pencils sold multiplied by the price of a pencil: 20 * $2 = $40.\nThe revenue from erasers is the number of erasers sold multiplied by the price of an eraser: 40 * $1 = $40.\nThe total revenue is the sum of the revenue from pencils and erasers: $40 + $40 = $80.\nHowever, this is not the total revenue the store earned.

Since half of the guests like weak coffee and the other half like strong coffee, the total number of cups is divided evenly between weak and strong coffee.\n\nLet's say x is the number of cups of weak coffee. Then, 12 - x is the number of cups of strong coffee.\n\nThe amount of coffee used for weak coffee is 1 tablespoon per cup, so the total amount of coffee used for weak coffee is 1x.\n\nThe amount of coffee used for strong coffee is unknown, but we know that the total amount of coffee used is 36 tablespoons. Since we're looking for the ratio of the amount of coffee used for strong coffee to the amount used for weak coffee, let's call the amount of coffee used for strong coffee \"y\". We know that 1x + y = 36.\n\nWe also know that x + (12 - x) = 12, since the total number of cups is 12. This simplifies to x = 6.\n\nSo, the number of cups of weak coffee is 6, and the number of cups of strong coffee is 12 - 6 = 6.\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of the amount of coffee used for strong coffee to the amount used for weak coffee. The amount of coffee used for strong coffee is y, and the amount used for weak coffee is 1x = 1(6) = 6. We know that 1x + y = 36, so we can substitute 6 for 1x and solve for y: 6 + y = 36, so y = 30.\n\nThe ratio of the amount of coffee used for strong coffee to the amount used for weak coffee is y:6, which is 30:6.

Since Shawn invested half of his savings in the simple interest bond, the principal amount for the simple interest bond is P/2.\n\nThe total interest Shawn received from both bonds is $550. The interest from the compound interest bond is unknown, let's call it Ic. So, the interest from the simple interest bond is $550 - Ic.\n\nWe know that the interest from the simple interest bond is I = P/2 * r * 2 = P/2 * r * 2 = P*r.\n\nWe also know that the total savings P is $2750.

For x = -1010, (x-20) and (x+20) are both negative, so this solution is also valid.\n\nThe sum of the two solutions is x1 + x2 = 1010 + (-1010) = 0.",
