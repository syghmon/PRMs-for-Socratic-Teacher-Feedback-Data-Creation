The price of an eraser would then be 'p/2'. \n\n### Hint\nDetermine the total revenue generated from selling the pencils and use this information to find the price of a pencil.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the price of a pencil\nLet's assume the store sold 20 pencils. Since we know the price of an eraser is 'p/2' and it costs $1, we can find 'p'.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from erasers\nWe know that for every pencil sold, 2 erasers are sold. So, for 20 pencils, the number of erasers sold would be 20 * 2 = 40 erasers. The total revenue from erasers would be 40 * $1 = $40.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from pencils\nLet's assume the price of a pencil is 'p'. The total revenue from selling 20 pencils would be 20 * p.\n\n### Step 4: Find the price of a pencil\nWe know that the total revenue from erasers is $40. We also know that the price of an eraser is 'p/2' and it costs $1. So, we can set up the equation: 40 = 20 * p/2. Solving for 'p', we get p = $2.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the total revenue\nThe total revenue from selling pencils would be 20 * $2 = $40. The total revenue from selling erasers is $40. So, the total revenue would be $40 + $40 = $80.\n\nHowever, this solution is not correct. We need to re-evaluate the problem and find the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the price of a pencil\nLet's assume the price of a pencil is 'p'. The price of an eraser would then be 'p/2'.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from erasers\nWe know that for every pencil sold, 2 erasers are sold. So, for 20 pencils, the number of erasers sold would be 20 * 2 = 40 erasers. The total revenue from erasers would be 40 * (p/2)",

In a right triangle, one angle is a right angle (exactly 90 degrees). In an obtuse triangle, one angle is obtuse (greater than 90 degrees).\n\n## Calculating the Semiperimeter\nTo calculate the angles of the triangle, we need to calculate the semiperimeter ($s$) of the triangle, which is half the perimeter of the triangle.\n\nThe perimeter ($P$) is the sum of the lengths of the three sides: $P = a + b + c = 9 + 10 + 12 = 31$\n\nThe semiperimeter ($s$) is half the perimeter: $s = \\frac{P}{2} = \\frac{31}{2} = 15.5$\n\n## Using Heron's Formula\nWe can use Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle, which is given by:\n\n$A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n$A = \\sqrt{15.5(15.5-9)(15.5-10)(15.5-12)}$\n$A = \\sqrt{15.5(6.5)(5.5)(3.5)}$\n$A = \\sqrt{15.5 \\times 110.25}$\n$A",

We need to find the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section.\n\n## Hint\nConsider the average of the first and last term of the series. This might help in identifying the pattern and finding the common difference.\n\n## Solution\nLet's denote the first term of the series as 'a' and the common difference as 'd'. Since the series is arithmetic, the sum of the series can be represented as:\n\nS = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d)\n\nwhere S is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms, and a is the first term.\n\nGiven that the sum of the series is 117, we can write:\n\n117 = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d)\n\nSince the series starts from 1, the first term 'a' is 1.\n\n## Step 1\nLet's assume the series has 'n' terms. Since the fifth house is the one we are interested in, we can assume that 'n' is greater than or equal to 5.\n\n## Step 2\nWe can represent the series as:\n\n1, 2, 3, ..., n\n\nThe sum of this series is given by:\n\nS = n/2 * (2*1 + (n-1)*d)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n117 = n/2 * (2 + (n-1)*d)\n\n## Step 3\nNow, let's try to find the common difference 'd'. We can do this by finding the difference between consecutive terms.\n\nFor example, the difference between the second term and the first term is:\n\n2 - 1 = 1\n\nThis is the common difference 'd'. However, we need to verify if this difference is consistent throughout the series.\n\n## Step 4\nTo verify the common difference, let's find the difference between the third term and the second term:\n\n3 - 2 = 1\n\nThe difference is indeed consistent. Therefore, the common difference 'd' is 1.\n\n## Step 5\nNow that we have the common difference, let's find the value of 'n'.

The hint suggests that we might need to use the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality.\n\n## Step 2: Apply AM-GM inequality to the expression\nThe AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers \\( a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \\), the following inequality holds:\n\\[ \\frac{a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdot ... \\cdot a_n} \\]\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the expression to apply AM-GM\nWe can rewrite the given expression as:\n\\[ \\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy = \\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + \\frac{xy}{1} \\]\n\n## Step 4: Apply AM-GM to the rewritten expression\nApplying AM-GM to the three terms, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{\\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{16}{x} \\cdot \\frac{108}{y} \\cdot xy} \\]\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the right-hand side, we get:\n\\[ \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{16}{x} \\cdot \\frac{108}{y} \\cdot xy} = \\sqrt[3]{16 \\cdot 108} = \\sqrt[3]{1728} = 12 \\]\n\n## Step 6: Multiply by 3 to get the original expression\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy \\geq 3 \\cdot 12 = 36 \\]\n\n## Step 7: Determine the equality condition\nThe equality condition for AM-GM is when all the terms are equal. In this case, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{16}{x} = \\frac{108}{y} = xy \\]\n\n## Step 8: Solve for x and y\nSolving the system of equations, we get:\n\\[ x =",

Then, we can use the information about the amount of coffee used for each type to find the ratio.\n\n## Step 1: Determine the number of cups of weak and strong coffee\nSince half of the guests like weak coffee and the other half like strong coffee, we can express the number of cups of weak coffee as 6 (half of 12).\n\n## Step 2: Solve for the number of cups of strong coffee\nWe know that W + S = 12, and W = 6. So, S = 12 - 6 = 6.\n\n## Step 3: Express the amount of coffee used for weak and strong coffee\nFor weak coffee, Taylor uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water. So, the total amount of coffee used for weak coffee is 6 * 1 = 6 tablespoons.

We know that the total amount of gasoline used is equal to the distance traveled on gasoline divided by the average mileage for the entire trip.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of gasoline used\nWe can use the given rate of gasoline usage (0.02 gallons per mile) to calculate the total amount of gasoline used for the entire trip.\n\n## Step 3: Set up an equation to relate the distance traveled on gasoline to the total amount of gasoline used\nLet x be the distance traveled on gasoline. We can set up an equation:\n\nTotal gasoline used = (Distance traveled on gasoline) / Average mileage\nTotal gasoline used = x / 55\n\nWe also know that the total amount of gasoline used is equal to the distance traveled on gasoline multiplied by the rate of gasoline usage:\n\nTotal gasoline used = (Distance traveled on gasoline) * (Rate of gasoline usage)\nTotal gasoline used = x * 0.02\n\n## Step 4: Solve for x\nWe can set up an equation using the two expressions for Total gasoline used:\n\nx / 55 = x * 0.02\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation\nWe can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 55:\n\nx = 55 * x * 0.02\n\n## Step 6: Solve for x\nWe can solve for x by dividing both sides by (55 * 0.02):\n\nx = 55 / (0.02 * 55)\nx = 100\n\nHowever, this is the distance traveled on gasoline.

    "teacher_raw_output": "## Problem Statement\n\nIf the price of gasoline increases by a certain percentage and a driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline, the driver should reduce the quantity of gasoline that he buys by 12%. What is the percentage increase in the price of gasoline?\n\n## Step 1: Understand the relationship between price, quantity, and total expenditure.\n\nLet's denote the original price of gasoline as P, the original quantity of gasoline bought as Q, and the total expenditure as E = P * Q. \n\n## Step 2: Determine the new price and quantity after the increase.\n\nAfter the price increase, the new price of gasoline is P + xP = (1 + x)P, where x is the percentage increase in the price of gasoline. The driver intends to spend 10% more, so the new total expenditure is 1.1E. The driver also reduces the quantity of gasoline by 12%, so the new quantity is 0.88Q.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the given conditions.\n\nThe new total expenditure is equal to the new price multiplied by the new quantity: (1 + x)P * 0.88Q = 1.1E.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute the expression for E and simplify the equation.\n\nSubstituting E = P * Q into the equation gives (1 + x)P * 0.88Q = 1.1PQ. Canceling out P and Q from both sides gives (1 + x) * 0.88 = 1.1.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for x.\n\nDivide both sides of the equation by 0.88: 1 + x = 1.25. Subtract 1 from both sides: x = 0.25.\n\n## Step 6: Convert the decimal to a percentage.\n\nTo express x as a percentage, multiply by 100: x = 0.25 * 100 = 25%.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{25}$",

The total number of students in the class is 48.\n\n## Step 2:  Calculate the z-score for the lower limit (80)\nTo find the number of students who scored between 80 and 90, we first need to calculate the z-score for the lower limit (80). The z-score formula is z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3, where X is the value we're interested in, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\n## Step 3:  Calculate the z-score for the upper limit (90)\nSimilarly, we calculate the z-score for the upper limit (90) using the same formula.\n\n## Step 4:  Use a z-table or calculator to find the area between the two z-scores\nWith the z-scores for both limits, we can use a z-table or a calculator to find the area between the two z-scores. This area represents the proportion of students who scored between 80 and 90.\n\n## Step 5:  Convert the area to a percentage and apply it to the total number of students\nTo find the number of students who scored between 80 and 90, we multiply the area by the total number of students (48).\n\n## Step 6:  Round the result to the nearest whole number\nThe result may not be a whole number, so we round it to the nearest whole number.\n\n## Step 7:  Use a z-table to find the area between the two z-scores\nSince we are not given a specific z-table, we can look up the z-scores in a standard z-table. The z-score for 80 is 0 and the z-score for 90 is 0.9.\n\n## Step 8:  Find the area between the z-scores\nLooking up the z-scores in a standard z-table, we find that the area to the left of z = 0.9 is approximately 0.8159. The area between the two z-scores is the difference between this value and the area to the left of z = 0, which is 0.5.\n\n## Step 9:  Calculate the area between the two z-scores\nThe area between the two z-scores is approximately 0.8159 -",

We are given that CP = $1250.\n## Step 2:  If the selling price had been increased by $500, there would have been a gain of 15%.

The derivative of the outer function $\\ln u$ is $\\frac{1}{u}$, and the derivative of the inner function $u = ax-1$ is $u' = a$.
