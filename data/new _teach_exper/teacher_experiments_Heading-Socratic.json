Find the bases of the original trapezoid if its lateral sides are equal to $c$ and $d$, where $c<d$.\n\n## Step 1\nLet's consider the trapezoid and the line that splits it. Since the line is parallel to the bases, it divides the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids. We can draw a perpendicular line from the point where the line intersects the shorter base to the longer base.\n\n## Step 2\nThis perpendicular line divides the longer base into two segments. Since the line is perpendicular to the bases, it also divides the trapezoid into two smaller right triangles. Let's call the length of the shorter segment of the longer base $x$.\n\n## Step 3\nNow, let's think about the relationship between the lengths of the sides of the trapezoid and the lengths of the bases of the two smaller trapezoids. How can we use the information about the lateral sides and the lengths of the bases to find the bases of the original trapezoid?\n\n## Step 4\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the lengths of the sides of the trapezoid and the lengths of the bases of the two smaller trapezoids.\n\n## Step 5\nWe need to find a relationship between the lengths of the bases of the two smaller trapezoids in terms of the lateral sides $c$ and $d$.\n\n## Step 6\nRecall that for a right trapezoid, the line that splits it into two smaller trapezoids divides the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids such that the ratio of the lengths of the bases of the smaller trapezoids is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the bases of the original trapezoid.\n\n## Step 7\nLet's use this relationship to find an expression for the lengths of the bases of the original trapezoid in terms of the lateral sides $c$ and $d$.\n\n## Step 8\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem and the relationship between the lengths of the bases of the two smaller trapezoids, we can derive an expression for the lengths of the bases of the original trapezoid.\n\n## Hint\nIf we draw a line",

How many hours does it take for Ryan to dig the hole alone?\n\n## Step 1\nLet's start by finding out how much work Castel can do in one hour. Since Castel can dig the hole in 6 hours, we can determine his hourly rate.\n\n## Step 2\nIf Castel's hourly rate is 1/6 of the hole per hour, then his rate of work can be expressed as 1/6. However, to find Ryan's rate of work, we need to first calculate the total work done by both Ryan and Castel when working together.\n\n## Step 3\nThe combined work rate of Ryan and Castel when working together is the reciprocal of the time it takes them to complete the hole together. This can be expressed as 1/2.72727272727.\n\n## Step 4\nTo find the combined work rate of Ryan and Castel, we can convert the time it takes them to complete the hole together into a fraction. 2.72727272727 hours is equivalent to 2.72727272727/1.\n\n## Step 5\nNow, let's calculate the combined work rate of Ryan and Castel.

This can be rewritten as $(3a)^{2} - 2(3a)(1) + (1)^{2} + (b)^{2} - 2(b)(1) = 0$, which further simplifies to $(3a-1)^{2} + (b-1)^{2} = 1$.\n\n## Step 2: Express $3a+b$ in terms of the new variables.\nTo find the maximum value of $3a+b$, we need to express it in terms of the new variables. We can write $3a+b = (3a-1) + (b+1)$. Since we have already expressed $(3a-1)^{2} + (b-1)^{2} = 1$, we can use this to find the maximum value of $3a+b$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the maximum value of $3a+b$.\nUsing the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1^2 + 1^2)((3a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2) \\ge (3a-1 + b-1)^2$.

The total amount of coffee used for strong coffee is 36 - 12 = 24 tablespoons.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the ratio of the amount of coffee used for strong coffee to the amount used for weak coffee.\nThe ratio of the amount of coffee used for strong coffee to the amount used for weak coffee is the total amount of coffee used for strong coffee divided by the total amount of coffee used for weak coffee. So, the ratio is 24:12, which simplifies to 2:1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2:1}$",

Since the car ran exclusively on gasoline for x - 40 miles, the total gasoline used is 0.02(x - 40).\n\n## Step 3\nWe also know that the average mileage for the entire trip was 55 miles per gallon. This means that the total distance traveled divided by the total amount of gasoline used should equal 55 miles per gallon.\n\n## Step 4\nWe can set up the equation: (40 + (x - 40)) / (0.02(x - 40)) = 55.\n\n## Step 5\nSimplifying the equation, we get: x / (0.02(x - 40)) = 55.\n\n## Step 6\nCross-multiplying, we get: x = 55 * 0.02(x - 40).\n\n## Step 7\nSimplifying further, we get: x = 1.1(x - 40).\n\n## Step 8\nExpanding the equation, we get: x = 1.1x - 44.\n\n## Step 9\nRearranging the equation, we get: 0.1x = 44.\n\n## Step 10\nDividing both sides by 0.1, we get: x = 440.\n\n## Hint\nWhat is the relationship between the total distance traveled and the amount of gasoline used for the entire trip, considering that the car ran on battery for a portion of it?",

So, we can set up the equation:\nx = 115% of $1250\nx = 1.15 * $1250\nx = $1437.50\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the initial selling price\nSince the selling price for a 15% gain is $1437.50, and the selling price had been increased by $500, the initial selling price (SP) is:\nSP = $1437.50 - $500\nSP = $937.50\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the loss percentage\nNow that we know the initial selling price (SP) and the cost price (CP), we can calculate the loss percentage:\nLoss percentage = ((CP - SP) / CP) * 100\n= (($1250 - $937.50) / $1250) * 100\n= (312.50 / 1250) * 100\n= 0.25 * 100\n= 25%\n\n### Hint\nWhat relationship exists between the initial selling price and the cost price when there is a loss? Can you express this relationship as a formula?",

If 8 of the drawn athletes are male, find the number of female athletes drawn. Express your answer as a whole number.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the concept of stratified sampling\nIn stratified sampling, the population is divided into distinct subgroups (strata) and a random sample is drawn from each subgroup. This method helps to ensure that the sample is representative of the population.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the proportion of male athletes in the sample\nSince 8 male athletes were drawn out of a total of 8 + x female athletes, we need to find the proportion of male athletes in the sample.\n\n## Step 3: Set up a proportion to find the total number of athletes drawn\nLet's assume the total number of athletes drawn is x + 8 (8 male athletes and x female athletes). We can set up a proportion to find the total number of athletes drawn.\n\n## Step 4: Use the proportion to find the number of female athletes drawn\nThe proportion of male athletes in the sample is equal to the proportion of male athletes in the population. We can use this proportion to find the number of female athletes drawn.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for x\nWe can solve for x by setting up the proportion: 8 / (x + 8) = 64 / 120\n\n## Step 6: Cross multiply and simplify\nCross multiplying gives us: 8 * 120 = 64 * (x + 8)\nSimplifying gives us: 960 = 64x + 512\n\n## Step 7: Subtract 512 from both sides\nSubtracting 512 from both sides gives us: 448 = 64x\n\n## Step 8: Divide both sides by 64\nDividing both sides by 64 gives us: x = 448 / 64\n\n## Step 9: Simplify\nSimplifying gives us: x = 7\n\n## Hint\nWhat is the total number of athletes drawn, and how does it relate to the proportion of male athletes in the sample?",

How many cups of flour has she already put in?\n\n### Hint\n\nIf Mary already added some flour and now needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of sugar, does that mean the total amount of flour she will add (including what's already been added) will be related to the amount of sugar in the recipe?\n\n### Step 1\nLet's denote the amount of flour Mary already put in as x. Since she needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of sugar, and the recipe calls for 14 cups of sugar, she will add 14 + 3 = 17 cups of flour in total.\n\n### Step 2\nThe total amount of flour in the recipe is 12 cups. If Mary already put in x cups of flour, then the total amount of flour she will add is (12 - x) cups.\n\n### Step 3\nSince Mary will add 17 cups of flour in total, we can set up an equation: x + (12 - x) = 17.\n\n### Step 4\nSolving the equation, we get 12 = 17.
