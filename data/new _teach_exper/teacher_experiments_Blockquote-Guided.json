    "ground_truth_answer": "\\$120",
    "teacher_raw_output": "### Problem: Selling Pencils and Erasers\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the price of pencils and erasers. The store has a rule that for every pencil bought, two erasers must be bought, and the erasers cost half the price of the pencils.\n\nLet's denote the price of a pencil as P. Since the erasers cost half the price of the pencils, the price of an eraser (E) is E = P/2.\n\nThe store sold 20 pencils. For every pencil sold, 2 erasers were sold. So, the total number of erasers sold is 20 * 2 = 40 erasers.\n\nThe price of each eraser is $1, but since the erasers cost half the price of the pencils, we need to find the price of the pencils first.\n\n### Guiding Principle\n\n> **Hint**: When dealing with ratios or proportions in pricing, consider the relationship between the quantities and their respective prices. In this case, the price of the erasers is directly related to the price of the pencils.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo find the price of the pencils, let's assume the price of the pencils is P. Since the erasers cost half the price of the pencils, the price of the erasers is $1 = P/2.\n\nSolving for P, we get P = $2.\n\nNow that we know the price of the pencils, we can calculate the total revenue from selling pencils and erasers.\n\nThe revenue from selling pencils is 20 * $2 = $40.\n\nThe revenue from selling erasers is 40 * $1 = $40.\n\nThe total revenue from selling pencils and erasers is $40 + $40 = $80, but we forgot that the problem stated that the erasers cost 1/2 the price of the pencils, so the erasers are $1 each, not half the price of a pencil.\n\nSince the erasers are $1 each and we know that the pencils are $2 each, we can recalculate the total revenue from selling pencils and erasers.\n\nThe revenue from selling pencils is 20 * $2 = $40.\n\nThe revenue from selling erasers is 40 * $1 = $40.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the erasers cost 1/2 the price of the pencils, so the erasers are $1 each. This is a contradiction, because the problem also states that the erasers cost 1/2 the price of the pencils",

He made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price. What was the discount percentage on the original price when he bought the car?\n\n### Solution\n20%\n\n### Guiding Principle\n> **Hint**: When calculating profit percentage, consider the relationship between the original price, the discount, and the selling price. The formula for profit percentage can be derived from the relationship: Profit Percentage = ((Selling Price - Original Price) / Original Price) * 100%. However, in this case, we need to account for the percentage increase in the selling price compared to the buying price.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n1. Let's denote the original price as P and the discount percentage as D.\n2. The buying price can be expressed as P - (P * D / 100).\n3. The selling price is 100% increase over the buying price, so it is 2 times the buying price.\n4. The profit percentage is given as 60.00000000000001% of the original price.\n5. Set up the equation: 2(P - (P * D / 100)) = P + (P * 0.60000000000001 / 100)\n6. Simplify and solve for D to find the discount percentage.\n```\n\n### Answer\n20%",

The cost price of the article was $1250. What was the loss percentage when the article was initially sold?\n\n### Solution\n25\\%\n\n### Guiding Principle\n> **Hint**: When dealing with percentage change problems, it can be helpful to use the formula for percentage change: (New Value - Old Value) / Old Value = (Percentage Change / 100). This formula can be rearranged to solve for the unknown value.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. Let x be the cost price of the article.\n2. The selling price is the cost price minus the loss. Let's call the loss y.\n3. The selling price is also the cost price minus 500 plus a 15% gain on 500. This can be written as: x - y = x - 500 + 0.15(500)\n4. Solve for y: x - y = x - 500 + 75\n5. Rearrange the equation to get: y = x - 425\n6. Since the cost price is $1250, substitute x = 1250 into the equation: y = 1250 - 425\n7. Solve for y: y = 825\n8. Now that we know the loss, we can find the loss percentage: Loss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) * 100\n9. Plug in the values: Loss Percentage = (825 / 1250) * 100\n10. Simplify the expression: Loss Percentage = 0.66 * 100\n11. Calculate the final value: Loss Percentage = 66%\n12. However, we know that the solution is 25%. Let's re-examine our steps and find the mistake.\n\n### Re-examining the Problem\n> **Hint**: When dealing with percentage change problems, it's essential to carefully consider the order of operations and the signs of the values involved.\n\n### Corrected Solution\n1. Let x be the cost price of the article.\n2. The selling price is the cost price minus the loss. Let's call the loss y.\n3. The selling price is also the cost price minus 500 plus a 15% gain on 500.

Jeff had 11 cards and then received 276 cards from Nell. After receiving these cards, Jeff's total number of cards is 11 + 276 = 287.\n\nNow, Nell has 252 cards left after giving 276 cards to Jeff. This means that the initial number of cards Nell had, x, minus 276, is equal to 252. We can write this as:\n\nx - 276 = 252\n\n### Guiding Principle or Formula\n\n> **Hint**: To find the initial number of cards Nell had, we can isolate x by adding 276 to both sides of the equation. This will give us the value of x, which is the initial number of cards Nell had.\n\n### Solution\n\nx - 276 = 252\nx = 252 + 276\nx = 528\n\nTherefore, Nell had 528 cards initially.",
