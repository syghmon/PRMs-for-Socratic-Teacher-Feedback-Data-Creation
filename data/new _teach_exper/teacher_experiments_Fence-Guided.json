Since you need to buy 2 erasers for every pencil, the total cost of 2 erasers is 2 * (x/2) = x dollars.\n3. Therefore, for every pencil sold, the total revenue is x + x = 2x dollars.\n4. Since they sold 20 pencils, the total revenue from pencils is 20 * 2x = 40x dollars.\n5. Since the price of one eraser is x/2 dollars, the price of 20 erasers is 20 * (x/2) = 10x dollars.\n6.

The derivative of the natural logarithm function is $\\frac{1}{x}$, and we need to multiply it by the derivative of the expression inside the logarithm. \n\nThe derivative of $ax-1$ with respect to $x$ is $a$. \n\nSo, the derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = \\frac{1}{ax-1} \\cdot a = \\frac{a}{ax-1}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute $x=2$ into the derivative to get $f'(2) = \\frac{a}{2a-1}$.\n\nWe are given that $f'(2) = 2$, so we can set up the equation $\\frac{a}{2a-1} = 2$.\n\nTo solve for $a$, we can cross-multiply to get $a = 2(2a-1)$.\n\nExpanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get $a = 4a - 2$.\n\nNow, we can isolate the variable $a$ by subtracting $4a$ from both sides of the equation to get $-3a = -2$.\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by $-3$, we get $a = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThis is the value of the real number $a$.",
