Half of the guests like weak coffee, so the number of cups of weak coffee is equal to the number of cups of strong coffee.\n3. Taylor uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water to make weak coffee. So, for 12 cups of weak coffee, he needs 12 tablespoons of coffee.\n4. However, the total amount of coffee needed is 36 tablespoons, which is more than the 12 tablespoons needed for weak coffee. This means that the amount of coffee used for strong coffee must be more than 12 tablespoons.\n5. Let's assume that Taylor uses x tablespoons of coffee for strong coffee. Then, the total amount of coffee used is 12 (for weak coffee) + x (for strong coffee).\n6. Since the total amount of coffee needed is 36 tablespoons, we can set up the equation: 12 + x = 36.\n\n### Socratic Question\n\n> **Hint:** What is the relationship between the number of cups of strong coffee and the amount of coffee used for strong coffee?",

Since group B has the largest population size, it will also have the largest sample size in the sample.\n\nThe total sample size is 6, and the population sizes of the three groups are 4, 12, and 8. You can calculate the proportion of the sample that comes from group B by dividing the population size of group B by the total population size and multiplying by the total sample size.\n\nLet's calculate the proportion of the sample that comes from group B:\n(12 / (4 + 12 + 8)) * 6 = 3.6\n\nSince you cannot select a fraction of a city, you round down to the nearest whole number.
