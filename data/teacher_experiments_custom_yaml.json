Then the sequence of house numbers will be a, a+1, a+2, a+3, a+4, ...\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of an AP is given by the formula: \n\nSn = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d)\n\nwhere Sn is the sum of the first n terms, a is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference.\n\nWe are given that the sum of house numbers is 117.

Therefore, we will just divide the weight of the bag by 2.\n\nWeight of the bag = 29/8 kg\nWeight of each 2m piece of the bag = (29/8 kg) / 2 = 29/16 kg\n\n#### Step 2: Calculate the weight of the chair after cutting it into 2 meters pieces\nSimilarly, to find the number of pieces the chair will be cut into, we divide its length by the length of each piece:\n4 m / 2 m = 2 pieces\n\nWeight of the chair = 2.8 kg\nWeight of each 2m piece of the chair = 2.8 kg / 2 = 1.4 kg\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the bag and chair after cutting them into 2 meters pieces\nNow, let's calculate the total weight by adding the weight of each piece of the bag and the chair:\nWeight of each 2m piece of the bag = 29/16 kg\nWeight of each 2m piece of the chair = 1.4 kg\n\nSince we cut the bag into 2 pieces and the chair into 2 pieces, we multiply the weight of each piece by 2 and add the weight of the remaining 1 meter piece of the bag:\nWeight of 2 pieces of the bag = (29/16 kg) * 2 = 29/8 kg\nWeight of the remaining piece of the bag = (29/8 kg) - (29/16 kg) = 29/16 kg\n\nTotal weight = Weight of 2 pieces of the bag + Weight of 2 pieces of the chair + Weight of the remaining piece of the bag\nTotal weight = (29/8 kg) + (1.4 kg) + (29/16 kg)\n\nTo add the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is",

The total amount of coffee used for strong coffee is zx\n- The total amount of coffee used is 36, so y + zx = 36\n\n### Ratio of Amount of Coffee Used for Strong Coffee to Weak Coffee\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the amount of coffee used for strong coffee to the amount used for weak coffee, which is zx:y.\n\n### Solution Steps\n\n1. We can start by solving the first equation for y: y = 12 - x\n2. We can substitute this expression for y into the second equation: (12 - x) + zx = 36\n3. We can simplify the equation: zx + 12 - x = 36\n4. We can rearrange the equation: zx - x = 36 - 12\n5. We can factor out x: x(z - 1) = 24\n6. We can divide both sides by (z - 1): x = 24 / (z - 1)\n7.

An odd function has the property that $f(-x) = -f(x)$.\n\nWe know that $F(-2) = 10$.

The function first defines the variables `total_bill`, `soda_price`, and `num_sodas`. It then calculates the total cost of the sodas by multiplying the soda price by the number of sodas. Finally, it calculates the change by subtracting the total cost from the total bill and returns the result.\n\n### Hint\nThis is a basic arithmetic problem that involves subtraction.",

    "ground_truth_answer": "60",
    "teacher_raw_output": "hint: Use the given relationships to create equations and solve for y as a percentage of z.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. If x is 20 percent more than y, then we can write an equation:\n   x = y + 0.20y\n   x = 1.20y\n\n2. We are given that x is 48 percent of z:\n   x = 0.48z\n\n3. Equating the two expressions for x, we get:\n   1.20y = 0.48z\n\n4. To find the percentage decrease of y compared to z, we need to express y as a percentage of z. Let's divide both sides of the equation by z:\n   1.20y/z = 0.48\n\n5. Now, we can express y as a percentage of z by multiplying both sides by 100:\n   (1.20y/z) * 100 = 0.48 * 100\n   120y/z = 48\n\n6. To find the percentage decrease, we need to subtract 100 from the result:\n   120y/z - 100 = 48 - 100\n   120y/z = -52\n\n7. Now, we can express y as a percentage of z by dividing both sides by 120:\n   (120y/z) / 120 = -52 / 120\n   y/z = -52/120\n   y/z = -0.4333\n\n8. To find the percentage decrease, we need to multiply by 100 and subtract 100:\n   (y/z) * 100 = -0.4333 * 100\n   y/z * 100 = -43.33\n   Percentage decrease = -43.33\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the percentage decrease, we should take the absolute value:\n   Percentage decrease = | -43.33 | = 43.33\n\nBut the given solution is 60, so let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem with the correct solution:\n\n1. If x is 20 percent more than y, then we can write an equation:\n   x = y + 0.20y\n   x = 1.20y\n\n2. We are given that x is 48 percent of z:\n   x = 0.48z\n\n3.

    "problem": "It takes Matt 2 minutes per problem to do his math homework with a calculator and a certain amount of time per problem without a calculator. If Matt's assignment has 20 problems, using a calculator will save him 60 minutes. How many minutes does it take Matt to do a problem without a calculator?",
    "ground_truth_answer": "5",
    "teacher_raw_output": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nLet's denote the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator as x minutes.\n\nSince it takes Matt 2 minutes per problem to do his math homework with a calculator, the total time it takes to solve 20 problems with a calculator is 2 * 20 = 40 minutes.\n\nWithout a calculator, the total time it takes to solve 20 problems is 20x minutes.\n\nWe are given that using a calculator will save Matt 60 minutes. This means the time saved is the difference between the time it takes to solve 20 problems without a calculator and the time it takes to solve 20 problems with a calculator.\n\nSo, we can write the equation as:\n20x - 40 = 60\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n20x = 60 + 40\n20x = 100\nx = 100 / 20\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, it takes Matt 5 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.\n\n```python\n# Define the variables\nnum_problems = 20\ntime_with_calculator = 2\ntime_saved = 60\n\n# Calculate the total time it takes to solve 20 problems with a calculator\ntotal_time_with_calculator = num_problems * time_with_calculator\n\n# Calculate the total time it takes to solve 20 problems without a calculator\ntotal_time_without_calculator = total_time_with_calculator + time_saved\n\n# Calculate the time it takes to solve one problem without a calculator\ntime_per_problem_without_calculator = total_time_without_calculator / num_problems\n\nprint(time_per_problem_without_calculator)\n```\n\nhint: \nThis problem can be solved using algebraic equations, and it is also suitable for coding with Python.",
