We know Castel's work rate is 1/6, so we can write the equation as:\n\nR + 1/6 = 1/2.72727272727\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can find a common denominator for 1/6 and 1/2.72727272727. We can rewrite 2.72727272727 as 10/3.7, so the common denominator is 3.7.\n\nR + 1/6 = 1/2.72727272727\nR + 3.7/22 = 10/3.7\n\nTo get rid of the fraction on the right-hand side, we can multiply both sides by 3.7:\n\n3.7R + 3.7/22 = 10\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by 22 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n3.7 * 22R + 3.7 = 220\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n81.4R + 3.7 = 220\n\nSubtracting 3.7 from both sides:\n\n81.4R = 216.3\n\nDividing both sides by 81.4:\n\nR = 216.3 / 81.4\nR = 2.657\n\nSince Ryan's work rate is 2.657 holes per hour, we can find the time it takes for him to dig the hole alone by dividing 1 by his work rate:\n\nTime = 1 / R\nTime = 1 / 2.657\nTime = 0.3757 * 4\nTime = 1.5 * 4/3\nTime = 2",

However, since the tank is empty in 12 hours, the net rate at which the tank is being emptied is (x/3) litres per hour. We can set up an equation to solve for x.\n```\n\nLet's set up the equation:\n\n- The combined rate at which the two inlet pipes fill the tank is 600 litres/hour.\n- The rate at which the leak empties the tank is x/3 litres/hour.\n- The net rate at which the tank is being emptied is (x/3) litres/hour.\n\nSince the tank is empty in 12 hours, the net rate at which the tank is being emptied is equal to the total capacity of the tank divided by the time it takes to empty the tank, which is x/12 litres/hour.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n600 - x/3 = x/12\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n7200 - 4x = x\n\nNow, we can add 4x to both sides of the equation:\n\n7200 = 5x\n\nNext, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n1440 = x\n\nTherefore, the cistern holds 1440 litres.",

    "teacher_raw_output": "To find the total length of the trip, we need to calculate the distance traveled on gasoline and the total distance traveled.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. The car ran exclusively on its battery for the first 40 miles. \n2. Then, it ran exclusively on gasoline for the rest of the trip.\n3. We know that the car used gasoline at a rate of 0.02 gallons per mile.\n4. We also know that the average mileage for the entire trip was 55 miles per gallon.\n\nLet's denote the total distance traveled as `x` miles. Since the average mileage is 55 miles per gallon, the total amount of gasoline used is `x/55` gallons.\n\nSince the car used gasoline at a rate of 0.02 gallons per mile, the distance traveled on gasoline is `(x/55) / 0.02 = x/1.1` miles.\n\nWe know that the distance traveled on gasoline is `x - 40` miles, since the car traveled 40 miles on battery.\n\nEquating these two expressions, we get:\n\n```math\nx/1.1 = x - 40\n```\n\nSolving for `x`, we get:\n\n```math\nx/1.1 - x = -40\nx(-1.1 + 1) = -40\n-0.1x = -40\nx = -40 / -0.1\nx = 400\n```\n\nHowever, we also know that the car ran exclusively on its battery for the first 40 miles.

Since the book in the middle has 297 pages, which is three times the number of pages of the shortest book, we can set up an equation to solve for 'x'.\n```\n\nSince the middle book has 297 pages and it's three times the number of pages of the shortest book, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n3x = 297\n\nTo solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\nx = 297 / 3\nx = 99\n\nNow that we know the number of pages in the shortest book is 99, we can find the ratio of the number of pages in the shortest book to the longest book:\n\nRatio = Shortest book / Longest book\n= 99 / 396\n\nTo simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 99:\n\nRatio = (99 / 99) / (396 / 99)\n= 1 / 4\n\nSo, the ratio of the number of pages in the shortest book to the longest book is 1:4.",
