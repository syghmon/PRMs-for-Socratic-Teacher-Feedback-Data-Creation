This shows that the function is shifted by \u03c0/8. Now, we want to find the period of this function. The general form of a sine function is f(x) = sin(b(x - c)), where the period is given by P = 2\u03c0/|b|.\n\nIn our case, b = 2. So, the period of the function is P = 2\u03c0/|2| = \u03c0.

However, we are looking for the value of 'a' such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) always holds true.\n\nLet's analyze the equation f(x+a) = f(x+3a). We can rewrite it as sin(2(x+a - \u03c0/8)) = sin(2(x+3a - \u03c0/8)).\n\nSince the sine function has the same value for any angle that differs by 2\u03c0, we can rewrite the equation as sin(2(x+a - \u03c0/8)) = sin(2(x+3a - \u03c0/8) + 2k\u03c0), where k is an integer.\n\nNow, we can equate the angles inside the sine functions: 2(x+a - \u03c0/8) = 2(x+3a - \u03c0/8) + 2k\u03c0.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 2a - 2\u03c0/8 = 6a",

    "teacher_raw_output": "## Hint\nTo solve this problem, we need to first find the rate of interest from the simple interest bond. We can then use this rate to calculate the interest received from the compound interest bond.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the principal invested in the simple interest bond\n\nLet's start by finding the amount invested in the simple interest bond. We know that Shawn invested half of his savings, which is $2750 / 2 = $1375 in the simple interest bond.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the rate of interest from the simple interest bond\n\nWe know that the simple interest bond paid $550 as interest over 2 years. We can use the formula for simple interest to find the rate of interest:\n\nSimple Interest = Principal * Rate * Time\n\nSince we know the interest, principal, and time, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the rate:\n\nRate = Simple Interest / (Principal * Time)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nRate = $550 / ($1375 * 2)\nRate = $550 / $2750\nRate = 0.2 or 20%\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the interest received from the compound interest bond\n\nNow that we know the rate of interest, we can use it to find the interest received from the compound interest bond. We know that the compound interest bond also invested $1375, and the interest is compounded annually for 2 years.\n\nWe can use the formula for compound interest to find the interest:\n\nCompound Interest = Principal * (1 + Rate)^Time - Principal\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nCompound Interest = $1375 * (1 + 0.2)^2 - $1375\nCompound Interest = $1375 * (1.2)^2 - $1375\nCompound Interest = $1375 * 1.44 - $1375\nCompound Interest = $1970 - $1375\nCompound Interest = $595\n\nHowever, we need to note that this is the total amount after 2 years. To find the interest, we subtract the principal from this amount:\n\nInterest = $1970 - $1375\nInterest = $595\n\nHowever, this value is not the final answer. We must subtract $10 from this value because $1375 invested in the compound interest bond would have grown to $1375 * (1 + 0.2)^2 = $1975. If we subtract $1375 from $1975, we get $600. But, the",

This can be expressed as: P(1 + x/100) * Q(1 - 12/100) = 1.1 * PQ.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation.\nWe can cancel out PQ from both sides of the equation, resulting in: (1 + x/100) * (1 - 12/100) = 1.1.\n\n## Step 4: Expand and simplify the equation.\nExpanding the equation, we get: (1 - 0.12) * (1 + x/100) = 1.1.

We are given the cost price and the information that if the selling price had been increased by $500, there would have been a gain of 15%. We can use this information to find the selling price and then calculate the loss percentage.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the selling price with a 15% gain\n\nLet's denote the cost price as CP and the selling price with a 15% gain as SP. We know that the cost price is $1250. With a 15% gain, the selling price would be 125% of the cost price. So, we can calculate the selling price as follows:\n\nSP = CP * (1 + 15/100)\nSP = 1250 * 1.15\nSP = 1437.50\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the original selling price\n\nWe are told that if the selling price had been increased by $500, there would have been a gain of 15%. This means that the original selling price was $500 less than the selling price with a 15% gain. Therefore, the original selling price is:\n\nOriginal SP = SP - 500\nOriginal SP = 1437.50 - 500\nOriginal SP = 937.50\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the loss percentage\n\nNow that we have the original selling price and the cost price, we can calculate the loss percentage. The loss percentage is the difference between the cost price and the selling price, divided by the cost price, multiplied by 100. So, the loss percentage is:\n\nLoss percentage = ((CP - Original SP) / CP) * 100\nLoss percentage = ((1250 - 937.50) / 1250) * 100\nLoss percentage = (312.50 / 1250) * 100\nLoss percentage = 25%\n\nTherefore, the loss percentage when the article was initially sold was 25%.",

We can set up a proportion to solve for x, the total number of athletes drawn.\n\n## Solution\nLet's set up a proportion:\n\n64/120 = 8/x\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n64x = 120 * 8\n64x = 960\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 64:\n\nx = 960 / 64\nx = 15\n\nSince 8 of the drawn athletes are male, the number of female athletes drawn can be found by subtracting the number of male athletes drawn from the total number of athletes drawn:\n\nNumber of female athletes drawn = x - 8\n= 15 - 8\n= 7\n\nHowever, we are asked to find the number of female athletes drawn given that 8 male athletes are drawn. This implies that we are looking for the number of female athletes in a sample where 8 male athletes are drawn. We will use the proportion of male to female athletes in the population to find the number of female athletes in the sample.\n\nThe proportion of male athletes in the population is 64/120, and in the sample is 8/x. We can set up a proportion to solve for x, the total number of athletes drawn:\n\n64/120 = 8/x\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n64x = 120 * 8\n64x = 960\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 64:\n\nx = 960 / 64\nx = 15\n\nNow that we have the total number of athletes drawn, we can find the number of female athletes drawn by subtracting the number of male athletes drawn from the total number of athletes drawn:\n\nNumber of female athletes drawn = x - 8\n= 15 - 8\n= 7\n\nHowever, we can also use the proportion of female athletes in the population to find the number of female athletes in the sample. The proportion of female athletes in the population is 56/120. We can set up a proportion:\n\n56/120 = y/15\n\nTo solve for y, we can cross-multiply:\n\n56 * 15 = 120 * y\n840 = 120y\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 120:\n\ny = 840 / 120\ny = 7\n\nSo the number of female athletes drawn is 7.",

The area of the uncovered portion is given as 64 square meters, and the length of the floor is given as 10 meters. Since the carpet covers the floor, we can assume that the uncovered portion is a rectangle with a length of 10 meters and an unknown width. We can use this information to find the width of the floor.\n\n### Solution\n\nLet's denote the width of the uncovered portion (and the width of the floor) as 'w'. Since the uncovered portion is a rectangle, its area can be represented as:\n\nArea = Length \u00d7 Width\n= 10w\n\nWe are given that the area of the uncovered portion is 64 square meters. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n10w = 64\n\nTo find the width 'w', we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:\n\nw = 64 \u00f7 10\nw = 6.4\n\nHowever, this is the width of the uncovered portion, not the width of the floor. Since the carpet is 4 meters on each side, it covers a portion of the floor that is 4 meters wide. Therefore, the width of the floor is the width of the uncovered portion plus the width of the carpet:\n\nWidth of floor = Width of uncovered portion + Width of carpet\n= 6.4 + 4\n= 10.4\n\nHowever, the width of the uncovered portion is 6.4 meters. The width of the uncovered portion, plus the width of the carpet on the left side, plus the width of the uncovered portion, plus the width of the carpet on the right side, is 10 meters. Since the carpet on the left and right sides is 4 meters, we can calculate the total width of the uncovered portion as:\n\nWidth of uncovered portion = 10 - 4 - 4\n= 2\n\nSince the width of the uncovered portion is 2 meters, we can calculate the width of the floor as:\n\nWidth of floor = Width of uncovered portion + Width of carpet\n= 2 + 4\n= 6\n\nHowever, the answer is given as 8 meters. To find the correct answer, let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\nSince the carpet is 4 meters on each side, it covers a portion of the floor that is 4 meters wide.
