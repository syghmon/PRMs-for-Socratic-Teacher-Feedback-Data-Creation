    "problem": "Natasha climbs up a hill, and descends along the same way she went up. It takes her 3 hours to reach the top and some hours to come back down. Her average speed along the whole journey is 3 kilometers per hour. What was her average speed (in kilometers per hour) while climbing to the top if it was 2.5 kilometers per hour?",
    "answer": "3.75",
    "solution": "Let's denote the distance to the top of the hill as \\( D \\) kilometers. Since Natasha's average speed while climbing to the top is 2.5 kilometers per hour, we can calculate the time it took her to reach the top using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\n\nGiven that it took her 3 hours to reach the top, we can write:\n\n\\[ 3 = \\frac{D}{2.5} \\]\n\nFrom this, we can solve for \\( D \\):\n\n\\[ D = 3 \\times 2.5 \\]\n\\[ D = 7.5 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nNow, we know the total distance of the journey (up and down the hill) is \\( 2D \\), which is:\n\n\\[ 2D = 2 \\times 7.5 \\]\n\\[ 2D = 15 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nLet's denote the time it took her to come back down as \\( T \\) hours. Her average speed for the whole journey is 3 kilometers per hour, and the total time for the whole journey is \\( 3 + T \\) hours. Using the average speed formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} \\]\n\nWe can write:\n\n\\[ 3 = \\frac{15}{3 + T} \\]\n\nNow we solve for \\( T \\):\n\n\\[ 3 + T = \\frac{15}{3} \\]\n\\[ 3 + T = 5 \\]\n\\[ T = 5 - 3 \\]\n\\[ T = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow we have the time it took her to come back down, which is 2 hours. To find her average speed while descending, we use the distance she covered while descending, which is the same as the distance going up, \\( D = 7.5 \\) kilometers, and the time \\( T = 2 \\) hours:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Speed (descending)} = \\frac{D}{T} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Speed (descending)} = \\frac{7.5}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Speed (descending)} = 3.75 \\text{ kilometers per hour} \\]\n\nSo, Natasha's average speed while descending was $\\boxed{3.75}$  kilometers per hour.",

    "solution": "From the given ellipse equation $\\frac {x^2}{16} + \\frac {y^2}{9} = 1$, we can find the ellipse's foci by calculating $c = \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}$ where $a$ and $b$ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively. In this case, we have $a = 4$ and $b = 3$, so\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{16 - 9} = \\sqrt{7}. \\]\n\nFor an ellipse, the shortest chord through a focus is perpendicular to the major axis. Here, the major axis is along the x-axis, so the shortest chord through focus F is vertical.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = \\sqrt{7}$ into the ellipse equation to find the corresponding y-values for the endpoints of this chord:\n\\[ \\frac{(\\sqrt{7})^2}{16} + \\frac{y^2}{9} = 1 \\implies \\frac{7}{16} + \\frac{y^2}{9} = 1. \\]\nSubtracting $\\frac{7}{16}$ from both sides, we get\n\\[ \\frac{y^2}{9} = 1 - \\frac{7}{16} = \\frac{9}{16}. \\]\nMultiplying both sides by 9, we have\n\\[ y^2 = \\frac{9}{16} \\times 9 = \\frac{81}{16}. \\]\nTaking the square root gives us\n\\[ y = \\pm \\frac{9}{4}. \\]\nSince we are looking for the length of the chord, we take the positive difference between the two y-values (which are equal and opposite), so the shortest chord length is\n\\[ 2 \\times \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{9}{2}. \\]\nThus, the length of the shortest chord passing through the focus F is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}}$.",

The mechanic also took a 30-minute break during which he was not paid. How many hours did the mechanic work, not including the break and considering the discount rate on labor cost?",
    "answer": "4.44",
    "solution": "First, let's calculate the total cost of the parts:\n\n2 parts * $20 each = $40\n\nNow, let's subtract the cost of the parts from the total amount Mark spent to find out how much was spent on labor:\n\n$220 total - $40 parts = $180 labor cost\n\nThe labor cost is $0.5 per minute for the first two hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the cost for the first two hours is:\n\n2 hours * 60 minutes/hour * $0.5/minute = $60\n\nNow, let's see if the $180 labor cost is covered by the first two hours of work at the regular rate:\n\nIf $180 is less than or equal to $60, then the mechanic worked only within the first two hours at the regular rate. However, since $180 is greater than $60, we know that the mechanic worked more than two hours and the additional hours are subject to a 10% discount.\n\nLet's calculate the discounted rate for labor after the first two hours:\n\n$0.5/minute * (1 - 10%) = $0.5/minute * 0.9 = $0.45/minute\n\nNow, let's find out how much labor cost is left after the first two hours:\n\n$180 labor cost - $60 for the first two hours = $120 remaining for discounted labor\n\nNow, let's calculate how many minutes of work this remaining $120 covers at the discounted rate:\n\n$120 / $0.45/minute = 266.67 minutes\n\nSince the mechanic took a 30-minute break, which is not paid, we need to add this time to the total minutes worked:\n\n266.67 minutes + 30 minutes = 296.67 minutes\n\nNow, let's convert the total minutes worked into hours:\n\n296.67 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4.94 hours\n\nSince we are asked for the number of hours worked not including the break and considering the discount rate, we will only consider the 266.67 minutes of actual work at the discounted rate, which is:\n\n266.67 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4.44 hours\n\nTherefore, the mechanic worked approximately $\\boxed{4.44}$  hours, not including the break and considering the discount rate on labor cost.",

    "solution": "To solve the problem, we start by understanding that a quadratic function $y=kx^{2}-4x-3$ intersects the coordinate axes at points where either $x=0$ or $y=0$. For the function to have three common points with the coordinate axes, it must intersect the $x$-axis at two distinct points and the $y$-axis at one point. The intersection with the $y$-axis occurs when $x=0$, which is always guaranteed. For the function to intersect the $x$-axis at two distinct points, the discriminant $\\Delta$ of the quadratic equation $kx^{2}-4x-3=0$ must be greater than $0$.\n\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ of a quadratic equation $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$ is given by $\\Delta=b^{2}-4ac$.

For the power of $x$ to be $6$ after multiplying by $x^2$ in $(x^2-a)(x+ \\frac {1}{x})^{10}$, we must have $10-2r = 4$ or $10-2r = 6$.\n\nSolving $10-2r = 4$, we get $r = 3$.\nSolving $10-2r = 6$, we get $r = 2$.\n\nThe coefficient of $x^6$ in the expansion without the $x^2-a$ factor is hence the sum of the coefficients from the terms where $r=2$ and $r=3$, which is $ C_{10}^{3} + C_{10}^{2}$.\n\nHowever, since the term $-ax^6$ is also present after multiplying by $(x^2-a)$, the total coefficient of $x^6$ is:\n$$ C_{10}^{3} - a \\cdot C_{10}^{2} = 30. $$\n\nWe can calculate $C_{10}^{3} = \\frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = 120$ and $C_{10}^{2} = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = 45$.\n\nLet's solve for $a$:\n$$ 120 - a \\cdot 45 = 30.$$\nSubtracting $120$ from both sides, we get:\n$$ -a \\cdot 45 = -90.$$\nDividing by $-45$, we find:\n$$ a = 2. $$\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",

From January to March, he volunteers at the shelter twice a month for 3 hours at a time. Starting from April to June, he starts volunteering once a week, but only for 2 hours at a time, at the pet adoption events. However, in July and August, he volunteers every Saturday and Sunday for 4 hours each day for the summer community service program. \nIn September and October, John volunteers once a week, on Thursdays for 3 hours each time, at the shelter.

    "solution": "Let's denote the lifespan of the bat as B, the lifespan of the hamster as H, and the lifespan of the frog as F.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n\nB = 10 years (lifespan of the bat)\n\nH = B - 6 years (since the hamster's lifespan is 6 years less than that of the bat)\nH = 10 - 6\nH = 4 years (lifespan of the hamster)\n\nThe total lifespan of all three animals is given as 30 years:\nB + H + F = 30\n\nWe already know B and H, so we can substitute those values in:\n10 + 4 + F = 30\n\nNow, let's solve for F:\nF = 30 - (B + H)\nF = 30 - (10 + 4)\nF = 30 - 14\nF = 16 years (lifespan of the frog)\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the lifespan of the frog to that of the hamster:\nRatio (Frog:Hamster) = F : H\nRatio (Frog:Hamster) = 16 : 4\n\nTo simplify the ratio, we divide both sides by the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 16 and 4, which is 4:\nRatio (Frog:Hamster) = (16 \u00f7 4) : (4 \u00f7 4)\nRatio (Frog:Hamster) = 4 : 1\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the lifespan of a frog to that of a hamster is $\\boxed{4:1}$ .",

    "answer": "10",
    "solution": "Let's denote the speed of the hare as \\( v \\) feet/second.\n\nThe turtle crawls at a speed of 1 foot/second and gets an 18-second head start.

    "solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that the car maintenance inspection costs a tenth of Chris's asking price. Since Chris is asking for $5200, the cost of the car maintenance inspection is:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{10} \\times 5200 = 520 \\)\n\nSo, if Chris accepts the first buyer's offer, he will pay $520 for the inspection and sell the car for $5200, effectively earning:\n\n\\( 5200 - 520 = 4680 \\)\n\nNow, let's consider the second buyer's offer.

Further simplification leads to $(x - n)(x + n + 20) = 68$.\n\nSince $m$ is a positive integer, $x$ must be greater than $n$. Therefore, we can factor 68 into several products: $1 \\times 68$, $2 \\times 34$, and $4 \\times 17$. Clearly, $(x + n + 20)$ must be greater than 20, so we exclude the products after $4 \\times 17$, leaving us with only the first two sets of factors.

The student's current mixture of 300 mL is 60% water and a certain percentage of hydrochloric acid. The student must add 100 mL of water to achieve his desired solution. What percentage of hydrochloric acid is in the current mixture?",
    "answer": "40\\%",
    "solution": "Let's start by calculating the amount of water and hydrochloric acid in the current mixture.\n\nThe current mixture is 60% water, so the amount of water in the current 300 mL mixture is:\n60% of 300 mL = 0.60 * 300 mL = 180 mL\n\nSince the mixture is made up of water and hydrochloric acid, the remaining 40% must be hydrochloric acid. So the amount of hydrochloric acid in the current 300 mL mixture is:\n40% of 300 mL = 0.40 * 300 mL = 120 mL\n\nNow, the student adds 100 mL of water to the mixture, making the total volume of the mixture 400 mL (300 mL original mixture + 100 mL added water).\n\nThe new amount of water in the mixture is:\n180 mL (original water) + 100 mL (added water) = 280 mL\n\nThe amount of hydrochloric acid remains the same since we are only adding water:\n120 mL (original hydrochloric acid)\n\nNow we need to find the new percentages of water and hydrochloric acid in the 400 mL mixture.\n\nThe percentage of water in the new mixture is:\n(280 mL water / 400 mL total mixture) * 100% = 70%\n\nThe percentage of hydrochloric acid in the new mixture is:\n(120 mL hydrochloric acid / 400 mL total mixture) * 100% = 30%\n\nThis confirms that the new mixture is 70% water and 30% hydrochloric acid, as desired.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of hydrochloric acid in the current mixture before adding the 100 mL of water is $\\boxed{40\\%}$ .",

To find the value of one part, we divide B's profit by 5:\nValue of one part = 1900 / 5 = Rs. 380\n\nNow we can find the profit shares of A and C:\nA's profit share = 4 parts = 4 * 380 = Rs. 1520\nC's profit share = 6 parts = 6 * 380 = Rs. 2280\n\nThe difference between the profit shares of A and C is:\nDifference = C's profit share - A's profit share\nDifference = 2280 - 1520 = Rs. 760\n\nTherefore, the difference between the profit shares of A and C is Rs. $\\boxed{760}$ .",

    "solution": "First, let's determine how many apples Jack currently has in his basket. If his basket is full at 12 apples and there's space for 4 more, that means he currently has 12 - 4 = 8 apples.\n\nNext, let's find out the full capacity of Jill's basket. Since Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's when full, and Jack's full basket holds 12 apples, Jill's basket can hold 2 * 12 = 24 apples when full.\n\nNow, to find out how many times Jack's current number of apples (8) could fit into Jill's basket (24), we divide the capacity of Jill's basket by the number of apples Jack currently has:\n\n24 (Jill's basket capacity) / 8 (Jack's current number of apples) = 3\n\nSo, Jack's current number of apples could fit into Jill's basket $\\boxed{3}$  times.",

We know that $a+b=3$, so we can substitute $a+b$ with $3$ in our expression. This gives us $2(a+b)-3ab$.\n3. Substituting $a+b$ with $3$ and $ab$ with $-1$, we get $2 \\times 3 - 3 \\times (-1)$.\n4. Performing the multiplication, we have $6 + 3$.\n5. Adding these together, we get $9$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $2a+2b-3ab$ is $\\boxed{9}$.",

    "solution": "When dealing with the constraint that two specific individuals must be adjacent, we can use the 'bundling method'. We treat person A and B as a single unit and consider the other 2 individuals as two separate units. This way, we have a total of 3 units to arrange. \n\nFirst, consider the bundle of person A and B. Within this bundle, A and B can arrange themselves in $2!$ ways since they can either stand as AB or BA.\n\nNext, we take the bundle and the other 2 individuals as 3 separate units. These units can be arranged in $3!$ ways.\n\nThe total number of different arrangements where A and B are adjacent is the product of these two permutations:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total arrangements} = 2! \\times 3! = 2 \\times 6 = 12.\n$$\n\nTherefore, when A and B are adjacent, there are $\\boxed{12}$ different arrangements.",

    "answer": "60",
    "solution": "Let's denote Peter's current age as P and his mother's current age as M.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n\n1) In four years, Peter will be twice as old as Harriet. So, we can write the equation:\nP + 4 = 2 * (Harriet's age in four years)\nSince Harriet is currently 13 years old, in four years, she will be 13 + 4 = 17 years old. So the equation becomes:\nP + 4 = 2 * 17\nP + 4 = 34\nP = 34 - 4\nP = 30\n\nSo, Peter is currently 30 years old.\n\n2) Peter's age is currently half of his mother's age. So we can write the equation:\nP = M / 2\n\nSince we've found that P is 30, we can substitute that into the equation to find M:\n30 = M / 2\nM = 30 * 2\nM = 60\n\nTherefore, Peter's mother is currently $\\boxed{60}$  years old.",
