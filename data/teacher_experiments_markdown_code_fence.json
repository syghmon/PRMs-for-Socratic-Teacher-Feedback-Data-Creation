This simplifies to 2x = 12, which means x = 6. Now, we need to find the ratio of coffee used for strong coffee to weak coffee.\n```\n\nLet's denote the number of cups of weak coffee as x.

For weak coffee, Taylor uses 1 tablespoon per cup, so the total amount of coffee used for weak coffee is 6 * 1 = 6 tablespoons. For strong coffee, let's assume the amount of coffee used per cup is y. The total amount of coffee used for strong coffee is 6 * y = 6y.\n\nWe know that the total amount of coffee used is 36 tablespoons.

The equation becomes:\n12 + 12y = 36\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n12y = 24\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\ny = 2\n\nThis means that the amount of coffee used per cup of strong coffee is",

We can start by understanding the behavior of absolute value functions and how they change based on the value of x.\n```\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to consider different cases based on the value of x.\n\nCase 1: x < -20\nIn this case, both (x-20) and (x+20) are negative. So, the equation becomes -(x-20) - (x+20) = 2020. Simplifying this, we get -2x - 40 = 2020.\n\nCase 2: -20 \u2264 x < 20\nIn this case, (x-20) is negative and (x+20) is non-negative. So, the equation becomes -(x-20) + (x+20) = 2020. Simplifying this, we get 40 = 2020, which is not possible.\n\nCase 3: x \u2265 20\nIn this case, both (x-20) and (x+20) are non-negative. So, the equation becomes (x-20) + (x+20) = 2020. Simplifying this, we get 2x = 2020.\n\nHowever, we can observe that regardless of the case, the absolute value expressions will always result in a non-negative value. But the sum of these values is equal to 2020, which is an even number. This means that the two absolute value expressions must have the same value, which is 1010.\n\nFor this to be true, x-20 and x+20 must have the same sign. This can only happen when x is less than -20 or greater than 20. But we already know that x \u2265 20 in the third case, so x must be less than -20.\n\nHowever, we also know that the sum of the two solutions is 0. Therefore, the two solutions must be equal and opposite, i.e., x1 = -x2.\n\nSo, we can write the equation as 2x = 2020, and then x = 1010. But since x = -x2, we have x2 = -1010.\n\nThe sum of the two solutions is x1 + x2 = 1010 - 1010 = 0.\n\n```python\n# Define the function to find the sum of the solutions",
