    "hint_text": "If you're setting up an equation, what are the two things that must be equal? Problem: The length of a rectangle is 6 cm more than its width. If the area of the rectangle is 120 square cm, what is the width of the rectangle? Solution: Let's call the width of the rectangle \"w\". The length of the rectangle is \"w + 6\". The area of a rectangle is length times width. So, we can set up the equation: w(w + 6) = 120 Now, let's expand the equation: w^2 + 6w = 120 Now, let's rearrange the equation: w^2 + 6w - 120 = 0 This is a quadratic equation. We can factor the left-hand side: (w + 12)(w - 10) = 0 Now, let's solve for w: w + 12 = 0 or w - 10 = 0 w = -12 or w = 10 Since the width of a rectangle cannot be negative, we can ignore the solution w = -12. So, the width of the rectangle is w = 10 cm. **HINT**: When you're given an equation in the form (x + a)(x + b) = 0, what are the two possible values of x? Problem: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 11 Solution: 2x + 5 = 11 Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 6 Divide both sides by 2: x = 3 **HINT**: What happens when you divide both sides of an equation by a number? Problem: Solve for x: x/4 + 2 = 9 Solution: x/4 + 2 = 9 Subtract 2 from both sides: x/4 = 7 Multiply both sides by 4: x = 28 **HINT**: When you multiply both sides of an equation by a number, what do you need to remember about the direction of the inequality sign? Problem: Solve for x: 4x - 3 = 25 Solution: 4x - 3 = 25 Add 3 to both sides: 4x = 28 Divide both sides by 4: x = 7 **HINT**: When you divide both sides of an equation by a number, what happens to the decimal places? Problem: Solve for x: 2x - 3 = 7 Solution: 2x - 3 = 7 Add 3 to both sides: 2x = 10 Divide both sides by 2: x = 5 **HINT**: When you divide both sides of an equation by a number, what do you need to remember about fractions? Problem: Solve for x: x - 2 = 9 Solution: x - 2 = 9 Add 2 to both sides: x = 11 **HINT**: When you add the same number to both sides of an equation, what happens to the value of x? Problem: Solve for x: x/2 + 3 = 7 Solution: x/2 + 3 = 7 Subtract 3 from both sides: x/2 = 4 Multiply both sides by 2: x = 8 **HINT**: When you multiply both sides of an equation by a number, what do you need to remember about the order of operations? Problem: Solve for x: 3x + 2 = 14 Solution: 3x + 2 = 14 Subtract 2 from both sides: 3x = 12 Divide both sides by 3: x = 4 **HINT**: When you divide both sides of an equation by a number, what do you need to remember about the reciprocal of a number? Problem: Solve for x: x/3 - 2 = 5 Solution: x/3 - 2 = 5 Add 2 to both sides: x/3 = 7 Multiply both sides by 3: x = 21 **HINT**: When you multiply both sides of an equation by a number, what do you need to remember about the commutative property? Problem: Solve for x: 2x - 4 = 12 Solution: 2x - 4 = 12 Add 4 to both sides: 2x = 16 Divide both sides by 2: x = 8 **HINT**: When you divide both sides of an equation by a number, what do you need to remember about the distributive property? Problem: Solve for x: 5x = 30 Solution: 5x = 30 Divide both sides by 5: x = 6 **HINT**: When you divide both sides of an equation by a number, what do you need to remember about the greatest common divisor?

If the area of the rectangle is 120 square cm, what is the width of the rectangle? Solution: Let's call the width of the rectangle \"w\". The length of the rectangle is \"w + 6\". The area of a rectangle is length times width. So, we can set up the equation: w(w + 6) = 120 Now, let's expand the equation: w^2 + 6w = 120 Now, let's rearrange the equation: w^2 + 6w - 120 = 0 This is a quadratic equation. We can factor the left-hand side: (w + 12)(w - 10) = 0 Now, let's solve for w: w + 12 = 0 or w - 10 = 0 w = -12 or w = 10 Since the width of a rectangle cannot be negative, we can ignore the solution w = -12. So, the width of the rectangle is w = 10 cm. **HINT**: When you're given an equation in the form (x + a)(x + b) = 0, what are the two possible values of x? Problem: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 11 Solution: 2x + 5 = 11 Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 6 Divide both sides by 2: x = 3 **HINT**: What happens when you divide both sides of an equation by a number? Problem: Solve for x: x/4 + 2 = 9 Solution: x/4 + 2 = 9 Subtract 2 from both sides: x/4 = 7 Multiply both sides by 4: x = 28 **HINT**: When you multiply both sides of an equation by a number, what do you need to remember about the direction of the inequality sign? Problem: Solve for x: 4x - 3 = 25 Solution: 4x - 3 = 25 Add 3 to both sides: 4x = 28 Divide both sides by 4: x = 7 **HINT**: When you divide both sides of an equation by a number, what happens to the decimal places? Problem: Solve for x: 2x - 3 = 7 Solution: 2x - 3 = 7 Add 3 to both sides: 2x = 10 Divide both sides by 2: x = 5 **HINT**: When you divide both sides of an equation by a number, what do you need to remember about fractions? Problem: Solve for x: x - 2 = 9 Solution: x - 2 = 9 Add 2 to both sides: x = 11 **HINT**: When you add the same number to both sides of an equation, what happens to the value of x? Problem: Solve for x: x/2 + 3 = 7 Solution: x/2 + 3 = 7 Subtract 3 from both sides: x/2 = 4 Multiply both sides by 2: x = 8 **HINT**: When you multiply both sides of an equation by a number, what do you need to remember about the order of operations? Problem: Solve for x: 3x + 2 = 14 Solution: 3x + 2 = 14 Subtract 2 from both sides: 3x = 12 Divide both sides by 3: x = 4 **HINT**: When you divide both sides of an equation by a number, what do you need to remember about the reciprocal of a number? Problem: Solve for x: x/3 - 2 = 5 Solution: x/3 - 2 = 5 Add 2 to both sides: x/3 = 7 Multiply both sides by 3: x = 21 **HINT**: When you multiply both sides of an equation by a number, what do you need to remember about the commutative property? Problem: Solve for x: 2x - 4 = 12 Solution: 2x - 4 = 12 Add 4 to both sides: 2x = 16 Divide both sides by 2: x = 8 **HINT**: When you divide both sides of an equation by a number, what do you need to remember about the distributive property? Problem: Solve for x: 5x = 30 Solution: 5x = 30 Divide both sides by 5: x = 6 **HINT**: When you divide both sides of an equation by a number, what do you need to remember about the greatest common divisor?
