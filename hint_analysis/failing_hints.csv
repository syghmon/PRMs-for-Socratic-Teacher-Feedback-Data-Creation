79,"Lindsey saved some money in September, $37 in October, and $11 in November. Her mom gave her $25 since she saved more than $75. After spending $87 on a video game, Lindsey had $36 left. How much money did Lindsey save in September?",,"If you're setting up an equation, what are the two things that must be equal? Problem: The length of a rectangle is 6 cm more than its width. If the area of the rectangle is 120 square cm, what is the width of the rectangle? Solution: Let's call the width of the rectangle ""w"". The length of the rectangle is ""w + 6"". The area of a rectangle is length times width. So, we can set up the equation: w(w + 6) = 120 Now, let's expand the equation: w^2 + 6w = 120 Now, let's rearrange the equation: w^2 + 6w - 120 = 0 This is a quadratic equation. We can factor the left-hand side: (w + 12)(w - 10) = 0 Now, let's solve for w: w + 12 = 0 or w - 10 = 0 w = -12 or w = 10 Since the width of a rectangle cannot be negative, we can ignore the solution w = -12. So, the width of the rectangle is w = 10 cm. **HINT**: When you're given an equation in the form (x + a)(x + b) = 0, what are the two possible values of x? Problem: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 11 Solution: 2x + 5 = 11 Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 6 Divide both sides by 2: x = 3 **HINT**: What happens when you divide both sides of an equation by a number?

How much money did Lindsey save in September?",,"If you're setting up an equation, what are the two things that must be equal? Problem: The length of a rectangle is 6 cm more than its width. If the area of the rectangle is 120 square cm, what is the width of the rectangle? Solution: Let's call the width of the rectangle ""w"". The length of the rectangle is ""w + 6"". The area of a rectangle is length times width. So, we can set up the equation: w(w + 6) = 120 Now, let's expand the equation: w^2 + 6w = 120 Now, let's rearrange the equation: w^2 + 6w - 120 = 0 This is a quadratic equation. We can factor the left-hand side: (w + 12)(w - 10) = 0 Now, let's solve for w: w + 12 = 0 or w - 10 = 0 w = -12 or w = 10 Since the width of a rectangle cannot be negative, we can ignore the solution w = -12. So, the width of the rectangle is w = 10 cm. **HINT**: When you're given an equation in the form (x + a)(x + b) = 0, what are the two possible values of x?
