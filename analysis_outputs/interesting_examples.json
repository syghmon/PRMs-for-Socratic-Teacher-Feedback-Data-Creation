Problem:  In a certain city, the average temperature in January is 40\u00b0F, and the average temperature in July is 80\u00b0F. If the average temperature in March is x\u00b0F, and it is known that the average temperature in March is exactly halfway between the average temperatures in January and July, what is the value of x? Solution:  First, let's find the difference between the average temperature in July and the average temperature in January: 80 - 40 = 40  Now, since the average temperature in March is halfway between the average temperatures in January and July, we can set up an equation to find the value of x: x = (40 + 80) / 2  Simplifying the equation: x = 120 / 2  x = 60  Therefore, the value of x is 60\u00b0F. **HINT**: If the average temperature in March is halfway between the average temperatures in January and July, what mathematical operation would you use to find the average of these two temperatures?  Now, let's take a look at the next problem. Problem:  A bakery sells 250 loaves of bread per day. They make a profit of $0.25 per loaf of bread sold. If the bakery operates 7 days a week and they sell bread for 52 weeks in a year, how much profit does the bakery make in a year? Solution:  First, let's calculate the number of loaves of bread sold in a year: 250 loaves/day * 7 days/week = 1750 loaves/week  Now, let's calculate the number of loaves of bread sold in a year: 1750 loaves/week * 52 weeks/year = 91000 loaves/year  Now, let's calculate the profit made by the bakery in a year: Profit = Number of loaves sold * Profit per loaf  Profit = 91000 loaves/year * $0.25/loaf  Profit = $22750/year  Therefore, the bakery makes a profit of $22750 in a year. **HINT**: If the bakery operates 7 days a week and they sell bread for 52 weeks in a year, how can you use this information to calculate the number of loaves of bread sold in a year?  Now, let's take a look at the next problem. Problem:  A group of friends want to share some candy equally. If they have 48 pieces of candy and there are 8 friends, how many pieces of candy will each friend get? Solution:  First, let's divide the total number of pieces of candy by the number of friends: 48 pieces / 8 friends = 6 pieces/friend  Therefore, each friend will get 6 pieces of candy. **HINT**: When dividing a total amount by the number of people, what operation are you performing?  Now, let's take a look at the next problem. Problem:  A car travels from City A to City B at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. On the return trip, the car travels at an average speed of 40 miles per hour. If the distance between City A and City B is 240 miles, how many hours does the trip take in total? Solution:  First, let's calculate the time it takes to travel from City A to City B: Time = Distance / Speed  Time = 240 miles / 60 mph  Time = 4 hours  Now, let's calculate the time it takes to travel from City B to City A: Time = Distance / Speed  Time = 240 miles / 40 mph  Time = 6 hours  Now, let's add the time it takes for each trip: Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours  Total time = 10 hours  Therefore, the total trip takes 10 hours. **HINT**: When calculating the time it takes to travel a certain distance, what formula do you use, and what are the two variables in this formula?  Now, let's take a look at the next problem. Problem:  A rectangular garden measures 15 meters by 25 meters. If a path that is 2 meters wide is built around the garden, what is the area of the path? Solution:  First, let's calculate the area of the garden: Area = Length * Width  Area = 15 meters * 25 meters  Area = 375 square meters  Now, let's calculate the dimensions of the garden with the path: Length = 15 meters + 2 meters + 2 meters = 19 meters  Width = 25 meters + 2 meters + 2 meters = 29 meters  Now, let's calculate the area of the garden with the path: Area = Length * Width  Area = 19 meters *"

Problem:  In a certain city, the average temperature in January is 40\u00b0F, and the average temperature in July is 80\u00b0F. If the average temperature in March is x\u00b0F, and it is known that the average temperature in March is exactly halfway between the average temperatures in January and July, what is the value of x? Solution:  First, let's find the difference between the average temperature in July and the average temperature in January: 80 - 40 = 40  Now, since the average temperature in March is halfway between the average temperatures in January and July, we can set up an equation to find the value of x: x = (40 + 80) / 2  Simplifying the equation: x = 120 / 2  x = 60  Therefore, the value of x is 60\u00b0F. **HINT**: If the average temperature in March is halfway between the average temperatures in January and July, what mathematical operation would you use to find the average of these two temperatures?  Now, let's take a look at the next problem. Problem:  A bakery sells 250 loaves of bread per day. They make a profit of $0.25 per loaf of bread sold. If the bakery operates 7 days a week and they sell bread for 52 weeks in a year, how much profit does the bakery make in a year? Solution:  First, let's calculate the number of loaves of bread sold in a year: 250 loaves/day * 7 days/week = 1750 loaves/week  Now, let's calculate the number of loaves of bread sold in a year: 1750 loaves/week * 52 weeks/year = 91000 loaves/year  Now, let's calculate the profit made by the bakery in a year: Profit = Number of loaves sold * Profit per loaf  Profit = 91000 loaves/year * $0.25/loaf  Profit = $22750/year  Therefore, the bakery makes a profit of $22750 in a year. **HINT**: If the bakery operates 7 days a week and they sell bread for 52 weeks in a year, how can you use this information to calculate the number of loaves of bread sold in a year?  Now, let's take a look at the next problem. Problem:  A group of friends want to share some candy equally. If they have 48 pieces of candy and there are 8 friends, how many pieces of candy will each friend get? Solution:  First, let's divide the total number of pieces of candy by the number of friends: 48 pieces / 8 friends = 6 pieces/friend  Therefore, each friend will get 6 pieces of candy. **HINT**: When dividing a total amount by the number of people, what operation are you performing?  Now, let's take a look at the next problem. Problem:  A car travels from City A to City B at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. On the return trip, the car travels at an average speed of 40 miles per hour. If the distance between City A and City B is 240 miles, how many hours does the trip take in total? Solution:  First, let's calculate the time it takes to travel from City A to City B: Time = Distance / Speed  Time = 240 miles / 60 mph  Time = 4 hours  Now, let's calculate the time it takes to travel from City B to City A: Time = Distance / Speed  Time = 240 miles / 40 mph  Time = 6 hours  Now, let's add the time it takes for each trip: Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours  Total time = 10 hours  Therefore, the total trip takes 10 hours. **HINT**: When calculating the time it takes to travel a certain distance, what formula do you use, and what are the two variables in this formula?  Now, let's take a look at the next problem. Problem:  A rectangular garden measures 15 meters by 25 meters. If a path that is 2 meters wide is built around the garden, what is the area of the path? Solution:  First, let's calculate the area of the garden: Area = Length * Width  Area = 15 meters * 25 meters  Area = 375 square meters  Now, let's calculate the dimensions of the garden with the path: Length = 15 meters + 2 meters + 2 meters = 19 meters  Width = 25 meters + 2 meters + 2 meters = 29 meters  Now, let's calculate the area of the garden with the path: Area = Length * Width  Area = 19 meters *"

Problem: Given that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, find the smallest possible value of $a+b+c$ such that $a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc=(a+b+c)^3$. Solution: 1.  Let $x=a+b+c$. 2.  Then, we have $a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc=x^3$. 3.  We want to find the smallest possible value of $x$ such that $x^3=a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc$. 4.  We can rewrite the equation as $a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc-(a+b+c)^3=0$. 5.  Notice that the left-hand side of the equation can be factored as $(a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-ac-bc)+3abc=0$. 6.  Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, $a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-ac-bc$ must be a positive integer. 7.  We can write this expression as $(a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2$. 8.  Therefore, we want to find the smallest positive integer $x$ such that $x((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)+3abc=0$. 9.  Since $x$ is a factor of $3abc$, we know that $x$ must be a multiple of $3$. 10.  Let $x=3k$, where $k$ is a positive integer. 11.  We want to find the smallest value of $k$ such that $3k((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)+3abc=0$. 12.  We can rewrite this equation as $k((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)+abc=0$. 13.  Since $k$ is a positive integer, we know that $k((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)$ is a positive integer. 14.  Therefore, we want to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $k((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)+abc=0$. 15.  We can write this equation as $k((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)=-abc$. 16.  Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, $abc$ must be a positive integer. 17.  Therefore, we want to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $k((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)=-abc$. 18.  We can rewrite this equation as $k((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)=-abc$. 19.  Since $k$ is a positive integer, we know that $k((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)$ is a positive integer. 20.  Therefore, we want to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $k((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)=-abc$. 21.  We can write this equation as $k((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)=-abc$. 22.  Since $k$ is a positive integer, we know that $k((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)$ is a positive integer. 23.

Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, $abc$ must be a positive integer. 26.  Therefore, we want to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $k((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)=-abc$. 27.  We can rewrite this equation as $k((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)=-abc$. 28.  Since $k$ is a positive integer, we know that $k((a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2)$ is a"
