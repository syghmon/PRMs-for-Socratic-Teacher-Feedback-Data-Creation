    "problem": "If the price of gasoline increases by a certain percentage and a driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline, the driver should reduce the quantity of gasoline that he buys by 12%. What is the percentage increase in the price of gasoline?",
    "teacher_hint": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about gasoline price increases and how much a driver is willing to spend. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nOkay, the driver wants to spend only 10% more on gasoline even though the price has gone up. But because of the price increase, he ends up reducing the quantity he buys by 12%. I need to find out by what percentage the price of gasoline increased.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. If the price goes up, the same amount of gasoline would cost more, so the driver would have to buy less to keep the total expenditure within 10% more than before. So, the percentage increase in price and the percentage decrease in quantity are related somehow.\n\nI remember that when two variables are inversely related, like price and quantity here, their percentage changes can be connected. Maybe I can use some kind of formula or relationship between percentage changes.\n\nLet me denote the original price as P and the original quantity as Q. So, the original total expenditure is P * Q.\n\nAfter the price increases by x%, the new price becomes P * (1 + x/100). The driver wants to spend only 10% more, so the new total expenditure is 1.10 * P * Q.\n\nThe quantity bought decreases by 12%, so the new quantity is Q * (1 - 12/100) = Q * 0.88.\n\nPutting it all together, the new expenditure is (1 + x/100) * (0.88 Q) = 1.10 P Q.\n\nWait, but P Q is the original expenditure, so I can set up the equation:\n\n(1 + x/100) * 0.88 = 1.10\n\nNow, I can solve for x. Let's see:\n\nDivide both sides by 0.88:\n\n1 + x/100 = 1.10 / 0.88\n\nCalculate 1.10 divided by 0.88. Let me do that on paper. 1.10 \u00f7 0.88 is approximately 1.25.\n\nSo, 1 + x/100 = 1.25\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\nx/100 = 0.25\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\nx = 25\n\nSo, the price increased by 25%.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. If the price goes up by 25%, and the driver buys 12% less, does the total expenditure go up by 10%?\n\nLet's test it. Suppose original price is $100, original quantity is 100 units. So, original expenditure is $10,000.\n\nAfter a 25% increase, the new price is $125. The driver buys 88 units instead of 100. So, new expenditure is 125 * 88 = $11,000.\n\nYes, $11,000 is a 10% increase from $10,000. That checks out. So, the percentage increase is indeed 25%.\n\nI think that makes sense. The key was setting up the equation correctly, relating the percentage changes in price and quantity to the total expenditure. It's about understanding how the two variables interact inversely when the expenditure is fixed in terms of percentage.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, you can use the concept of percentage change and set up an equation based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step hint:\n\n1. Let the original price of gasoline be \\( P \\) and the original quantity purchased be \\( Q \\). The original total expenditure is \\( P \\times Q \\).\n\n2. After a percentage increase in price, let the new price be \\( P \\times (1 + \\frac{x}{100}) \\), where \\( x \\) is the percentage increase.\n\n3. The driver intends to spend only 10% more, so the new total expenditure is \\( 1.10 \\times P \\times Q \\).\n\n4. The quantity purchased decreases by 12%, so the new quantity is \\( Q \\times (1 - \\frac{12}{100}) = Q \\times 0.88 \\).\n\n5. Set up the equation: \\( (1 + \\frac{x}{100}) \\times 0.88 = 1.10 \\).\n\n6. Solve for \\( x \\) to find the percentage increase in price.\n\nGood luck!",

    "problem": "To strengthen environmental awareness, the Environmental Protection Bureau randomly selects 3 out of 5 local chemical plants (A, B, C, D, E) for wastewater compliance testing each week.

    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I have this problem where the Environmental Protection Bureau is selecting 3 out of 5 chemical plants (A, B, C, D, E) each week. I need to find the probability that both plant A and plant B are selected in a week. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I should start by determining the total number of ways to select 3 plants out of 5. That sounds like a combination problem because the order in which the plants are selected doesn't matter.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 5 and k is 3. So, let me calculate that.\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5 - 3)!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (3 * 2 * 1 * 2 * 1) = (120) / (6 * 2) = 120 / 12 = 10. So, there are 10 possible ways to select any 3 plants out of 5.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the selections that include both plant A and plant B. If both A and B are selected, that means we've already chosen 2 out of the 3 plants, so we need to choose 1 more plant from the remaining 3 (C, D, E). So, the number of ways to choose the third plant is C(3, 1).\n\nCalculating C(3, 1) is straightforward: it's 3! / (1! * (3 - 1)!) = (6) / (1 * 2) = 3. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes where both A and B are selected.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 3 / 10.\n\nWait, let me just double-check. If there are 10 total combinations and 3 of them include both A and B, then yes, the probability is 3/10. That makes sense because we're selecting 3 plants, and only a portion of those combinations include both A and B.\n\nI think that's it. The key was to recognize that once A and B are selected, we just need to choose one more plant from the remaining three, and then compute the probability accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo find the probability that both plant A and B are selected, first calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 plants out of 5, which is a combination problem. Then, determine how many of these selections include both A and B by choosing the remaining plant from the other 3. The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total outcomes.\n\n$\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{10}}$",

    "problem": "Let the function $f(x) = \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}}x$ have an inverse function denoted by $g(x)$. Then find the range of the function $y = g(x)$ on the interval $[1, 2]$.",
    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I need to figure out the range of the inverse function g(x) for f(x) = log base 1/2 of x, specifically on the interval [1, 2]. Hmm, let me start by recalling what inverse functions do. If f is a function and g is its inverse, then f(g(x)) = x and g(f(x)) = x. That means that for every x in the domain of g, g(x) will give me a value that when plugged back into f gives me x, and vice versa.\n\nFirst, I should probably find the inverse function g(x). To do that, I can start by writing y = log_{1/2}(x) and then switch x and y to get x = log_{1/2}(y). Then, I can solve for y in terms of x. Remembering the logarithm definition, if x = log_{1/2}(y), then (1/2)^x = y. So, that means g(x) = (1/2)^x. Got it, so g(x) is an exponential function with base 1/2.\n\nNow, I need to find the range of g(x) on the interval [1, 2]. Since g(x) is an exponential function, I know its behavior. The base is 1/2, which is between 0 and 1, so the function is decreasing. That means as x increases, g(x) decreases. Therefore, the maximum value of g(x) on the interval [1, 2] will occur at the left endpoint, x=1, and the minimum value will occur at the right endpoint, x=2.\n\nCalculating g(1): (1/2)^1 = 1/2.\n\nCalculating g(2): (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nSince the function is decreasing, the range will be all the values between 1/4 and 1/2, including both endpoints. So, the range is [1/4, 1/2].\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I plug in x=1, I get 1/2, and x=2 gives me 1/4. Since it's a decreasing function, yes, the outputs go from 1/2 down to 1/4 as x goes from 1 to 2. So the range should indeed be [1/4, 1/2]. I think that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could also consider the domain of the original function f(x) to help me understand the range of its inverse. The original function f(x) = log_{1/2}(x) has a domain of x > 0 and a range of all real numbers. Its inverse, g(x), will have a domain equal to the range of f(x), so g(x) is defined for all real numbers, and its range will be the domain of f(x), which is x > 0. But in this case, we're only looking at x in [1, 2], so we're restricting the domain of g(x) to [1, 2], which as I found earlier, maps to [1/4, 1/2].\n\nJust to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me think about what the inverse function represents. Since f(x) = log_{1/2}(x) is a logarithmic function, it's a decreasing function because the base is between 0 and 1. Therefore, its inverse, g(x), should be an exponential function, which is indeed what I found. Exponential functions with bases between 0 and 1 are decreasing, so as x increases, g(x) decreases, which aligns with my earlier conclusion.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the relationship between f and g. Since g is the inverse, the range of g on [1, 2] is the same as the domain of f restricted to the outputs that correspond to [1, 2]. Wait, actually, no. The domain of g is all real numbers, but when we're looking at the range of g on [1, 2], it's the set of g(x) for x between 1 and 2. Since g is decreasing, the smallest x (1) gives the largest g(x) (1/2), and the largest x (2) gives the smallest g(x) (1/4). So yes, the range is [1/4, 1/2].\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. The key points are understanding how inverse functions work, recognizing the behavior of the exponential function with base 1/2, and correctly evaluating the function at the endpoints of the interval. Everything seems consistent, so I feel confident in my answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the range of the inverse function \\( g(x) \\) of \\( f(x) = \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}}x \\) on the interval \\([1, 2]\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the inverse function \\( g(x) \\):**\n   - Start with \\( y = \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}}x \\).\n   - Swap \\( x \\) and \\( y \\): \\( x = \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}}y \\).\n   - Solve for \\( y \\): \\( y = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^x \\).\n   - Thus, \\( g(x) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^x \\).\n\n2. **Determine the behavior of \\( g(x) \\):**\n   - Since the base \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) is between 0 and 1, \\( g(x) \\) is a decreasing exponential function.\n\n3. **Evaluate \\( g(x) \\) at the endpoints of the interval \\([1, 2]\\):**\n   - \\( g(1) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n   - \\( g(2) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n4. **Conclude the range:**\n   - Since \\( g(x) \\) is decreasing, the maximum value is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) at \\( x = 1 \\), and the minimum value is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) at \\( x = 2 \\).\n   - Therefore, the range of \\( g(x) \\) on \\([1, 2]\\) is \\(\\left[\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right]\\).\n\n**Answer:** The range of the function \\( y = g(x) \\) on the interval \\([1, 2]\\) is \\(\\left[\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right]\\).",

On a trip the car ran exclusively on its battery for the first 40 miles, then ran exclusively on gasoline for the rest of the trip, using gasoline at a rate of 0.02 gallons per mile. If the average mileage for the entire trip was 55 miles per gallon, what was the total length of the trip in miles? Express your answer as a whole number.",
    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Roy's hybrid car. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the car runs on battery for the first 40 miles, and then on gasoline for the rest. Gasoline is used at 0.02 gallons per mile. The average mileage for the whole trip is 55 miles per gallon. I need to find the total length of the trip.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The trip has two parts: battery and gasoline. The battery part is straightforward\u2014it's 40 miles. The gasoline part is unknown, so let me call that 'x' miles. So the total trip distance is 40 + x miles.\n\nNow, for the gasoline part, the car uses 0.02 gallons per mile. So the total gasoline used for that part would be 0.02 times x, which is 0.02x gallons.\n\nThe average mileage is given as 55 miles per gallon. That means, overall, for every gallon of gasoline used, the car goes 55 miles. But wait, the car also used battery, so I need to make sure I'm calculating the average correctly.\n\nAverage mileage is total miles divided by total gallons used. The total miles are 40 + x. The total gallons used are only from gasoline because the battery doesn't use gasoline. So the gasoline used is 0.02x gallons.\n\nPutting that together, the average mileage would be (40 + x) divided by 0.02x, and that equals 55. So the equation is:\n\n(40 + x) / (0.02x) = 55\n\nNow, I can solve for x. Let me rewrite the equation:\n\n(40 + x) = 55 * 0.02x\n\nCalculating 55 * 0.02, which is 1.1. So:\n\n40 + x = 1.1x\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n40 = 0.1x\n\nThen, x = 40 / 0.1 = 400 miles.\n\nSo the gasoline part is 400 miles. Adding the initial 40 miles, the total trip is 440 miles.\n\nWait, let me check if this makes sense. If the car drove 400 miles on gasoline at 0.02 gallons per mile, that's 8 gallons used. Then, the total gallons used is 8. The total miles are 440. 440 divided by 8 is indeed 55 miles per gallon. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo the total trip length is 440 miles.\n</think>\n\nTo find the total length of the trip, let \\( x \\) represent the miles driven on gasoline. The total distance is \\( 40 + x \\) miles, and the gasoline used is \\( 0.02x \\) gallons. The average mileage is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{40 + x}{0.02x} = 55\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n40 + x = 1.1x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 40 = 0.1x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 400\n\\]\n\nThe total trip length is \\( 40 + 400 = 440 \\) miles.",

    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to understand what it's asking. \n\nFirst, the problem says that we have an arithmetic sequence {a_n} with a non-zero common difference d. That means each term is the previous term plus d. So, a1 is the first term, a2 = a1 + d, a3 = a1 + 2d, and so on. \n\nThen, it mentions that the terms a1, a3, and a9 form a geometric sequence. Hmm, okay, so a geometric sequence is one where each term is multiplied by a constant ratio to get the next term. So, if I have three terms in a geometric sequence, the middle term squared should equal the product of the first and the third terms. That is, (a3)^2 = a1 * a9. That's a key property I can use here.\n\nSo, my first step is to express a3 and a9 in terms of a1 and d. Let's write that out:\n\na3 = a1 + 2d\n\na9 = a1 + 8d\n\nNow, since a1, a3, a9 form a geometric sequence, plugging into the geometric sequence condition:\n\n(a3)^2 = a1 * a9\n\nSubstituting the expressions we have:\n\n(a1 + 2d)^2 = a1 * (a1 + 8d)\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n(a1)^2 + 4a1d + 4d^2 = a1^2 + 8a1d\n\nNow, subtract a1^2 from both sides:\n\n4a1d + 4d^2 = 8a1d\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n4a1d + 4d^2 - 8a1d = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-4a1d + 4d^2 = 0\n\nFactor out 4d:\n\n4d(-a1 + d) = 0\n\nSince d is non-zero, we can divide both sides by 4d:\n\n-a1 + d = 0\n\nWhich gives:\n\nd = a1\n\nSo, the common difference d is equal to the first term a1. That's an important relation.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the value of (a1 + a3 + a9) divided by (a2 + a4 + a10). Let me write expressions for each term in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nFirst, the numerator:\n\na1 + a3 + a9 = a1 + (a1 + 2d) + (a1 + 8d)\n\nSince d = a1, let's substitute that in:\n\n= a1 + (a1 + 2a1) + (a1 + 8a1)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n= a1 + 3a1 + 9a1\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= (1 + 3 + 9)a1 = 13a1\n\nNow, the denominator:\n\na2 + a4 + a10 = (a1 + d) + (a1 + 3d) + (a1 + 9d)\n\nAgain, substitute d = a1:\n\n= (a1 + a1) + (a1 + 3a1) + (a1 + 9a1)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n= 2a1 + 4a1 + 10a1\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= (2 + 4 + 10)a1 = 16a1\n\nSo now, the ratio is (13a1)/(16a1). Since a1 is non-zero (because d is non-zero and d = a1), we can cancel a1:\n\n13/16\n\nSo, the value is 13/16.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Expressed a3 and a9 correctly: yes, a3 = a1 + 2d, a9 = a1 + 8d.\n\n2. Applied the geometric sequence condition: (a3)^2 = a1 * a9: correct.\n\n3. Expanded and simplified the equation: led me to d = a1: seems right.\n\n4. Substituted d = a1 into numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: a1 + (a1 + 2a1) + (a1 + 8a1) = 13a1: that looks correct.\n\nDenominator: (a1 + a1) + (a1 + 3a1) + (a1 + 9a1) = 16a1: correct.\n\nRatio: 13/16: that seems right.\n\nI think I did everything correctly.

Let me compute \\( (\\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} - 3x)^2 \\).\n\nCalculating that: \\( (\\sqrt{1 + 9x^2})^2 - 2 \\times \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} \\times 3x + (3x)^2 \\).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n1. \\( (\\sqrt{1 + 9x^2})^2 = 1 + 9x^2 \\)\n2. \\( -2 \\times \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} \\times 3x = -6x \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} \\)\n3. \\( (3x)^2 = 9x^2 \\)\n\nAdding them together: \\( 1 + 9x^2 - 6x \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} + 9x^2 = 1 + 18x^2 - 6x \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} \\).\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem particularly helpful. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps if I let \\( y = \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} - 3x \\), then maybe I can find an expression for \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) or vice versa.\n\nLet me set \\( y = \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} - 3x \\). Then, if I solve for \\( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} \\), I get \\( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} = y + 3x \\). Now, let's square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\( 1 + 9x^2 = (y + 3x)^2 = y^2 + 6xy + 9x^2 \\).\n\nSubtracting \\( 9x^2 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\( 1 = y^2 + 6xy \\).\n\nSo, \\( y^2 + 6xy - 1 = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic in terms of \\( y \\), but I'm not sure if that's useful yet. Maybe if I solve for \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\), but that might not lead me anywhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the function \\( f(x) \\) and see if it's odd or even, or has some symmetry. Let me compute \\( f(-x) \\) and see.\n\nSo, \\( f(-x) = \\ln( \\sqrt{1 + 9(-x)^2} - 3(-x) ) + 1 = \\ln( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} + 3x ) + 1 \\).\n\nComparing this to \\( f(x) \\), which is \\( \\ln( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} - 3x ) + 1 \\), it's not immediately clear if \\( f(-x) \\) is related to \\( f(x) \\) in a simple way. Maybe if I compute \\( f(x) + f(-x) \\), that could be useful.\n\nLet me compute \\( f(x) + f(-x) \\):\n\n\\( f(x) + f(-x) = \\ln( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} - 3x ) + \\ln( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} + 3x ) + 2 \\).\n\nUsing the logarithm property that \\( \\ln a + \\ln b = \\ln(ab) \\), this becomes:\n\n\\( \\ln[ ( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} - 3x )( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} + 3x ) ] + 2 \\).\n\nMultiplying the terms inside the logarithm:\n\n\\( ( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} )^2 - (3x)^2 = (1 + 9x^2) - 9x^2 = 1 \\).\n\nSo, the logarithm of 1 is 0, so \\( f(x) + f(-x) = 0 + 2 = 2 \\).\n\nWow, that's a nice result! So, \\( f(x) + f(-x) = 2 \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nNow, looking back at the problem, I need to find \\( f(\\lg 2) + f(\\lg \\frac{1}{2}) \\). But \\( \\lg \\frac{1}{2} = \\lg 2^{-1} = -\\lg 2 \\). So, \\( \\lg \\frac{1}{2} = - (\\lg 2) \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( f(\\lg 2) + f(\\lg \\frac{1}{2}) = f(a) + f(-a) \\) where \\( a = \\lg 2 \\). From the result above, \\( f(a) + f(-a) = 2 \\).\n\nSo, the value is 2.\n\nWait, that was pretty straightforward once I noticed the symmetry. I think that's the key insight here: recognizing that \\( f(x) + f(-x) = 2 \\), so when you plug in \\( x \\) and \\( -x \\), their function values add up to 2. Therefore, regardless of what \\( x \\) is, as long as \\( x \\) and \\( -x \\) are in the domain, their function values will add to 2.\n\nSo, the problem simplifies to recognizing that \\( \\lg \\frac{1}{2} = - \\lg 2 \\), so the two terms are \\( f(a) \\) and \\( f(-a) \\), whose sum is 2.\n\nI think that's the solution. It's interesting how recognizing the symmetry in the function can make the problem much easier. I didn't see that at first, but once I calculated \\( f(x) + f(-x) \\), it became clear.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the function \\( f(x) \\) is constructed such that when you add \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f(-x) \\), the logarithmic terms combine in a way that the product inside the log becomes 1, so the log term is 0, leaving just the constants which add up to 2.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the hint. The key is to notice the relationship between \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f(-x) \\) and how they add up to a constant value. Then, applying that to the specific arguments given in the problem, which are negatives of each other, leads directly to the solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( f(\\lg 2) + f(\\lg \\dfrac{1}{2}) \\) is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the function \\( f(x) = \\ln( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} - 3x ) + 1 \\) and need to find the value of \\( f(\\lg 2) + f(\\lg \\frac{1}{2}) \\).\n\nFirst, we note that \\( \\lg \\frac{1}{2} = -\\lg 2 \\). Therefore, we need to evaluate \\( f(a) + f(-a) \\) where \\( a = \\lg 2 \\).\n\nWe compute \\( f(-x) \\):\n\\[ f(-x) = \\ln( \\sqrt{1 + 9(-x)^2} - 3(-x) ) + 1 = \\ln( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} + 3x ) + 1 \\]\n\nNext, we add \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f(-x) \\):\n\\[ f(x) + f(-x) = \\ln( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} - 3x ) + \\ln( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} + 3x ) + 2 \\]\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, we combine the terms:\n\\[ \\ln[ ( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} - 3x )( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} + 3x ) ] + 2 \\]\n\nMultiplying the terms inside the logarithm:\n\\[ ( \\sqrt{1 + 9x^2} )^2 - (3x)^2 = 1 + 9x^2 - 9x^2 = 1 \\]\n\nThus, the logarithm of 1 is 0, so:\n\\[ f(x) + f(-x) = 0 + 2 = 2 \\]\n\nApplying this result to our specific arguments, we find:\n\\[ f(\\lg 2) + f(\\lg \\frac{1}{2}) = f(a) + f(-a) = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the value is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation: x\u00b2 - 2x + m = 0. The problem says that after completing the square, it becomes (x - 1)\u00b2 = n. I need to find m + n. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that completing the square is a method used to solve quadratic equations. The general form is ax\u00b2 + bx + c, and to complete the square, you take the coefficient of x, divide by 2, square it, and add it to both sides. Wait, but in this case, the equation is already almost in the form needed for completing the square.\n\nLooking at the given equation, x\u00b2 - 2x + m = 0. I can rewrite this as x\u00b2 - 2x = -m. Now, to complete the square on the left side, I need to take the coefficient of x, which is -2, divide by 2 to get -1, and then square it to get 1. So, I add 1 to both sides to maintain the equality.\n\nThat would give me: x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 = -m + 1. The left side can now be written as a perfect square: (x - 1)\u00b2 = -m + 1. But the problem states that after completing the square, it's (x - 1)\u00b2 = n. So, comparing the two, n must be equal to -m + 1.\n\nSo, n = -m + 1. That means m + n = m + (-m + 1). Let me compute that: m - m is 0, so m + n = 0 + 1 = 1. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should express the original equation in terms of the completed square. The original equation is x\u00b2 - 2x + m = 0. When we complete the square, we have (x - 1)\u00b2 = n. Expanding (x - 1)\u00b2 gives x\u00b2 - 2x + 1. So, comparing to the original equation, x\u00b2 - 2x + m = 0, it's like x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 = n. Therefore, m must be 1, because x\u00b2 - 2x + m is x\u00b2 - 2x + 1, so m = 1. Then, n is equal to the right-hand side, which is n. But wait, from the completed square, we have (x - 1)\u00b2 = n, which is equal to x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 = n. Comparing to the original equation, which is x\u00b2 - 2x + m = 0, so x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 = n. Therefore, m is 1, and n is 1 as well because x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 is both sides.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if m is 1, then the equation is x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 = 0, which factors to (x - 1)\u00b2 = 0, so n would be 0. But the problem says after completing the square, it's (x - 1)\u00b2 = n. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the steps.\n\nLet me start over. The original equation is x\u00b2 - 2x + m = 0. To complete the square, take the coefficient of x, which is -2, divide by 2 to get -1, square it to get 1. So, add 1 to both sides: x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 = -m + 1. The left side is (x - 1)\u00b2, so (x - 1)\u00b2 = -m + 1. Therefore, n = -m + 1.\n\nSo, m + n = m + (-m + 1) = 1. That seems consistent. So, regardless of the value of m, when you add m and n, you get 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If m is 1, then n would be -1 + 1 = 0. So, m + n is 1 + 0 = 1. If m is something else, say m = 2, then n = -2 + 1 = -1, so m + n = 2 + (-1) = 1. It still adds up to 1. So, regardless of m, m + n is always 1.\n\nSo, the value of m + n is 1.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, complete the square on the quadratic equation. The completed square form is given as \\((x - 1)^2 = n\\). By comparing the completed square to the original equation, determine the values of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), then add them together.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe value of \\(m + n\\) is \\boxed{1}.",

    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the coordinates of the point corresponding to \\( i \\cdot \\overline{z} \\) in the complex plane. The given complex number is \\( z = \\dfrac{2}{-1 - i} \\).

So, I need to find \\( \\overline{z} \\) first. But before that, maybe I should simplify \\( z \\) itself because it's given in a fraction form with a complex denominator.\n\nTo simplify \\( z = \\dfrac{2}{-1 - i} \\), I think I should multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it.

So, multiplying both numerator and denominator by \\( -1 + i \\) should help.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n\\( z = \\dfrac{2}{-1 - i} \\times \\dfrac{-1 + i}{-1 + i} \\)\n\nMultiplying the numerators: 2 times (-1 + i) is \\( -2 + 2i \\).\n\nMultiplying the denominators: (-1 - i)(-1 + i). I can use the formula \\( (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2 \\), so here \\( a = -1 \\) and \\( b = i \\).

    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the 100th term of a sequence. The sequence is formed by all powers of 3 or the sum of several distinct powers of 3, arranged in ascending order. The sequence starts as 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, and so on. Hmm, interesting. \n\nFirst, let me try to understand the pattern here. The terms given are 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13. I notice that each term is either a single power of 3 or a combination of distinct powers of 3 added together. For example, 1 is 3^0, 3 is 3^1, 4 is 3^0 + 3^1, 9 is 3^2, 10 is 3^2 + 3^0, 12 is 3^2 + 3^1, and 13 is 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0. \n\nSo, it seems like each term can be represented by a combination of different powers of 3. That makes me think of binary numbers because in binary, each digit represents a power of 2, and each position can either be 0 or 1, indicating whether that power is included or not. Maybe there's a similar concept here with base 3?\n\nWait, if I consider each term as a sum of distinct powers of 3, it's similar to binary where each bit represents a power, but instead of base 2, it's base 3. So maybe each number in the sequence corresponds to a binary number where each bit is a coefficient for a power of 3. For example, the binary number 1 is 1, which would correspond to 3^0 = 1. The binary number 10 is 2 in decimal, which would correspond to 3^1 = 3. Binary 11 is 3 in decimal, which would correspond to 3^1 + 3^0 = 4. Similarly, binary 100 is 4, which would correspond to 3^2 = 9, and so on.\n\nSo, if I think of each term in the sequence as a binary representation where each bit represents whether a certain power of 3 is included, then the nth term in the sequence is the value of the binary representation of n interpreted in base 3. For example, the 4th term would be binary 100, which is 4 in decimal, so in base 3, it's 100, which is 9. \n\nLet me test this with the given terms. The 1st term is 1. Binary 1 is 1, which in base 3 is 1. The 2nd term is 3. Binary 10 is 2 in decimal, which in base 3 is 10, which is 3. The 3rd term is 4. Binary 11 is 3 in decimal, which in base 3 is 11, which is 1*3 + 1 = 4. The 4th term is 9, which is binary 100, which is 100 in base 3, which is 9. Yeah, that seems to fit.\n\nSo, if this pattern holds, then to find the 100th term, I can convert 100 into binary and then interpret that binary number as a base 3 number. \n\nFirst, let's convert 100 into binary. 100 divided by 2 is 50 with remainder 0, then 50 divided by 2 is 25 with remainder 0, 25 divided by 2 is 12 with remainder 1, 12 divided by 2 is 6 with remainder 0, 6 divided by 2 is 3 with remainder 0, 3 divided by 2 is 1 with remainder 1, and 1 divided by 2 is 0 with remainder 1. So, writing the remainders from last to first, 100 in binary is 1100100.\n\nNow, interpreting 1100100 as a base 3 number. Each digit represents a power of 3, starting from the right. So, from right to left, the digits are 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1. Let's calculate the value:\n\nThe rightmost digit is 0 * 3^0 = 0\nNext is 0 * 3^1 = 0\nThen 1 * 3^2 = 9\nNext is 0 * 3^3 = 0\nThen 0 * 3^4 = 0\nNext is 1 * 3^5 = 243\nFinally, the leftmost digit is 1 * 3^6 = 729\n\nAdding these up: 729 + 243 + 9 = 981\n\nWait, that seems too big. The 100th term is 981? Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the binary number. Let me write it out properly. The binary number is 1100100, which is 7 digits long. So, when interpreting it in base 3, the leftmost digit is the highest power. So, the digits are 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0. \n\nSo, the value would be:\n\n1 * 3^6 + 1 * 3^5 + 0 * 3^4 + 0 * 3^3 + 1 * 3^2 + 0 * 3^1 + 0 * 3^0\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1 * 729 = 729\n\n1 * 243 = 243\n\n0 * 81 = 0\n\n0 * 27 = 0\n\n1 * 9 = 9\n\n0 * 3 = 0\n\n0 * 1 = 0\n\nAdding these up: 729 + 243 = 972, plus 9 is 981. So, yes, 981.\n\nBut wait, let me cross-verify. Maybe I should think about how many numbers are there with up to n digits in base 3. Each term corresponds to a binary number where each digit is 0 or 1, indicating whether a power of 3 is included. So, the number of terms with up to k digits in base 3 is 2^k - 1. For example, with 1 digit, we have 1 number (1). With 2 digits, 3 numbers (3, 4, 9). Wait, that doesn't seem right because 2^2 -1 is 3, but in our sequence, the first few terms are 1,3,4,9,10,12,13,... So, up to 3^2 is 9, which is the 4th term.\n\nWait, maybe I need a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps each term in the sequence corresponds to the numbers that can be represented without a 2 in their base 3 expansion. That is, numbers that in base 3 only have digits 0 or 1. So, the sequence is all numbers whose base 3 representations consist solely of 0s and 1s, arranged in ascending order.\n\nIf that's the case, then each number in the sequence can be associated with a binary number, where each bit represents whether a certain power of 3 is included. So, the nth term is the value of the binary representation of n, interpreted in base 3.\n\nFor example, n=1 is 1 in binary, which is 1 in base 3, which is 1. n=2 is 10 in binary, which is 10 in base 3, which is 3. n=3 is 11 in binary, which is 11 in base 3, which is 4. n=4 is 100 in binary, which is 100 in base 3, which is 9. That matches the given sequence.\n\nSo, to find the 100th term, I need to convert 100 into binary, which is 1100100, and then interpret that binary number as a base 3 number. So, 1100100 in base 3 is equal to 1*3^6 + 1*3^5 + 0*3^4 + 0*3^3 + 1*3^2 + 0*3^1 + 0*3^0.\n\nCalculating this:\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^2 = 9\n\nAdding them up: 729 + 243 + 9 = 981.\n\nSo, the 100th term should be 981.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 981 seems too big. Let me check with smaller numbers to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor n=5, binary is 101, which in base 3 is 1*9 + 0*3 +1=10, which matches the 5th term. n=6 is 110 in binary, which is 1*9 + 1*3 +0=12, which is correct. n=7 is 111 in binary, which is 1*9 +1*3 +1=13, correct. n=8 is 1000 in binary, which is 1*27=27, which would be the 8th term, and so on. So, yes, the pattern holds.\n\nTherefore, for n=100, converting 100 to binary is 1100100, interpreting that as base 3 gives 981. So, the 100th term is 981.\n</think>\n\nTo find the 100th term of the sequence, recognize that each term corresponds to a binary representation interpreted in base 3. Convert 100 to binary (1100100) and interpret it in base 3, yielding 981.\n\n**Answer:** The 100th term is 981.",

    "teacher_hint": "Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to find vector **b**. Let me try to understand what's given and what I need to do.\n\nFirst, I know that there are two vectors, **a** and **b**, such that when you add them together, you get the vector (6, -3, -6). So, mathematically, that's:\n\n**a** + **b** = (6, -3, -6)\n\nNow, **a** is parallel to the vector (1, 1, 1). Hmm, if **a** is parallel to that vector, that means **a** is just a scalar multiple of (1, 1, 1). So, I can write **a** as:\n\n**a** = k*(1, 1, 1) where k is some scalar.\n\nThat makes sense. So, **a** is just scaling the vector (1, 1, 1) by some factor k. Cool, so I can express **a** in terms of k.\n\nNext, **b** is orthogonal to (1, 1, 1). Orthogonal means perpendicular, right? So, the dot product of **b** and (1, 1, 1) should be zero. Let me write that down:\n\n**b** \u2022 (1, 1, 1) = 0\n\nWhich translates to:\n\nb\u2081 + b\u2082 + b\u2083 = 0\n\nWhere b\u2081, b\u2082, b\u2083 are the components of vector **b**.\n\nSo, now I have two equations:\n\n1. **a** + **b** = (6, -3, -6)\n2. **a** = k*(1, 1, 1)\n3. **b** \u2022 (1, 1, 1) = 0\n\nLet me substitute equation 2 into equation 1. That gives me:\n\nk*(1, 1, 1) + **b** = (6, -3, -6)\n\nSo, if I rearrange that, **b** = (6, -3, -6) - k*(1, 1, 1)\n\nLet me write that out component-wise:\n\nb\u2081 = 6 - k\nb\u2082 = -3 - k\nb\u2083 = -6 - k\n\nSo, now I have expressions for each component of **b** in terms of k. But I also know that **b** is orthogonal to (1, 1, 1), which gives me the equation:\n\nb\u2081 + b\u2082 + b\u2083 = 0\n\nLet me substitute the expressions for each b component into this equation:\n\n(6 - k) + (-3 - k) + (-6 - k) = 0\n\nSimplify this:\n\n6 - k - 3 - k - 6 - k = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(6 - 3 - 6) + (-k - k - k) = 0\n\nCalculating the constants:\n\n(6 - 3 - 6) = -3\n\nAnd the coefficients of k:\n\n(-k - k - k) = -3k\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n-3 - 3k = 0\n\nNow, solve for k:\n\n-3k = 3\n\nDivide both sides by -3:\n\nk = -1\n\nOkay, so k is -1. Now, plug this back into the expressions for **b**:\n\nb\u2081 = 6 - (-1) = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nb\u2082 = -3 - (-1) = -3 + 1 = -2\n\nb\u2083 = -6 - (-1) = -6 + 1 = -5\n\nSo, vector **b** is (7, -2, -5). Let me just double-check to make sure everything adds up.\n\nFirst, **a** should be parallel to (1,1,1), so with k = -1, **a** is (-1, -1, -1). Let's add **a** and **b**:\n\n(-1, -1, -1) + (7, -2, -5) = (6, -3, -6)\n\nWhich matches the given vector. Also, check if **b** is orthogonal to (1,1,1):\n\n7 + (-2) + (-5) = 7 - 2 -5 = 0\n\nYep, that works out. So, I think I did this correctly.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nWe had **a** = k*(1,1,1), so **a** = (k, k, k).\n\nThen, **b** = (6, -3, -6) - **a** = (6 - k, -3 - k, -6 - k).\n\nThen, the dot product of **b** with (1,1,1) is:\n\n(6 - k) + (-3 - k) + (-6 - k) = 6 -3 -6 -3k = -3 -3k = 0\n\nSo, -3k = 3 => k = -1.\n\nPlugging back in, **b** = (6 - (-1), -3 - (-1), -6 - (-1)) = (7, -2, -5). Yep, that looks correct.\n\nI think I've got it. So, the vector **b** is (7, -2, -5).\n</think>\n\nTo solve for vector **b**, express **a** as a scalar multiple of (1,1,1), then use the orthogonality condition to find the scalar. Finally, compute **b** by subtracting **a** from the given sum.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ -2 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}}$",

    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so Mary is baking a cake, and the recipe needs 12 cups of flour, 14 cups of sugar, and 7 cups of salt. But she's already put in some flour, and now she needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of salt. Hmm, wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the recipe requires 12 cups of flour in total. Mary has already added some amount, let's call that 'x' cups. Now, she needs to add more flour now, and the amount she needs to add is 3 cups more than the amount of salt she's going to add. The salt is 7 cups in total, but I'm not sure if she's adding all of it or just some. Wait, the problem says she needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of salt now. So, maybe she's adding the salt now, but she hasn't added all of it yet? Or is she adding some salt now and more flour than that?\n\nWait, the problem says she's already put in some flour and now needs to add more flour than salt. So, let's think. The total flour needed is 12 cups. She's already put in 'x' cups, so she needs to add (12 - x) more cups of flour. Now, she needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of salt. The salt she needs to add is 'y' cups. So, (12 - x) = y + 3.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't mention how much salt she has already added. It just says she needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of salt now. Maybe she's only adding salt now and hasn't added any yet. Or perhaps she's adding salt now and needs to add 3 more flour than that. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem might be that she has already added some flour, and now she needs to add flour in a way that it's 3 more than the salt she's adding now. But the total salt needed is 7 cups. So, if she adds 'y' cups of salt now, she needs to add 'y + 3' cups of flour now. But she's already added 'x' cups of flour, so the total flour she needs to add now is (12 - x) = y + 3.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how much salt she's adding now. Maybe she's adding all the salt, so y = 7. Then, she needs to add 7 + 3 = 10 cups of flour now. But she needs a total of 12 cups of flour, so she already put in 12 - 10 = 2 cups. That seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she hasn't added any salt yet, so y = 0, but that would mean she needs to add 3 cups of flour now, but she needs a total of 12, so she already put in 9. But that seems less likely because the problem mentions salt in the recipe.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to look at it is that she needs to add 3 more cups of flour than she has added of salt. So, if she's already added 's' cups of salt, she needs to add 's + 3' cups of flour now. But the total flour needed is 12, and she's already added 'x' cups, so she needs to add (12 - x) = s + 3. But we don't know 's'. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, the problem says she needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of salt now. So, the amount of flour she needs to add now is 3 more than the salt she needs to add now. But the total salt she needs is 7, so maybe she's adding all the salt now, which is 7 cups, so she needs to add 7 + 3 = 10 cups of flour now. Since the total flour needed is 12, she already put in 12 - 10 = 2 cups.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the hint would be to set up an equation where the flour she needs to add now is 3 more than the salt she's adding now, and since she's adding all the salt, solve for the flour she already put in.\n</think>\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the cups of flour Mary has already put in. She needs to add \\( 3 \\) more cups of flour than cups of salt. Since the recipe requires \\( 7 \\) cups of salt, she needs to add \\( 7 + 3 = 10 \\) cups of flour now.

    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve this algebra problem. The expression given is x\u00b2 - 6x + b, and it's supposed to be equivalent to (x - a)\u00b2 - 1. I remember that completing the square is a method used to convert a quadratic expression into a perfect square trinomial, which is exactly what's happening here. \n\nFirst, I should expand the right side of the equation, which is (x - a)\u00b2 - 1. Expanding (x - a)\u00b2 gives me x\u00b2 - 2ax + a\u00b2. So, subtracting 1 from that, the entire expression becomes x\u00b2 - 2ax + (a\u00b2 - 1). \n\nNow, I can compare this to the original expression, x\u00b2 - 6x + b. Since these two expressions are equal for all x, their corresponding coefficients must be equal. That means the coefficient of x\u00b2 is 1 in both, so that's consistent. Next, the coefficient of x in the original expression is -6, and in the expanded form, it's -2a. So, setting these equal gives me -2a = -6. Solving for a, I can divide both sides by -2, which gives a = 3.\n\nNow that I have a, I can find b by comparing the constant terms. In the expanded form, the constant term is a\u00b2 - 1, and in the original expression, it's b. So, substituting a = 3, I get b = (3)\u00b2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8.\n\nFinally, the question asks for b - a. So, I subtract a from b: 8 - 3 = 5. That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, compare the coefficients of the quadratic expressions by expanding \\((x - a)^2 - 1\\) and setting it equal to \\(x^2 - 6x + b\\).

    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I have this problem here: If n is less than m, which is less than 0, I need to simplify the expression sqrt(m\u00b2 + 2mn + n\u00b2) minus sqrt(m\u00b2 - 2mn + n\u00b2). Hmm, let's see. I remember that square roots can sometimes be simplified if the expressions inside are perfect squares. \n\nFirst, let me look at each square root separately. Starting with the first one: sqrt(m\u00b2 + 2mn + n\u00b2). Wait a minute, that looks familiar. Isn't that the expansion of (m + n)\u00b2? Let me check: (m + n)\u00b2 is m\u00b2 + 2mn + n\u00b2. Yeah, so the first square root simplifies to |m + n|. But since n is less than m and both are negative, m + n must be negative because adding two negative numbers makes a more negative number. So, the absolute value of a negative number is its positive counterpart. Therefore, sqrt(m\u00b2 + 2mn + n\u00b2) is -(m + n).\n\nNow, moving on to the second square root: sqrt(m\u00b2 - 2mn + n\u00b2). Similarly, I think this is the expansion of (m - n)\u00b2. Let me verify: (m - n)\u00b2 is m\u00b2 - 2mn + n\u00b2. So, that one simplifies to |m - n|. Now, since n < m, m - n is positive because subtracting a smaller number from a larger one gives a positive result. Therefore, the absolute value here is just m - n.\n\nSo now, substituting back into the original expression, we have: sqrt(m\u00b2 + 2mn + n\u00b2) - sqrt(m\u00b2 - 2mn + n\u00b2) becomes -(m + n) - (m - n). Let me simplify that. Distribute the negative sign: -m - n - m + n. Combining like terms: (-m - m) + (-n + n) which is -2m + 0. So, the entire expression simplifies to -2m.\n\nWait, let me double-check. I had sqrt(m\u00b2 + 2mn + n\u00b2) as -(m + n) because m + n is negative. Then sqrt(m\u00b2 - 2mn + n\u00b2) is (m - n) because m - n is positive. So subtracting them gives -(m + n) - (m - n). That's correct. Expanding that, it's -m - n - m + n. The -n and +n cancel out, leaving -2m. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, the simplified expression is -2m. Since m is negative, -2m would be positive. That makes sense because both square roots are positive, and we're subtracting them. But wait, let me think again. If m is negative, then -2m would indeed be positive. So, that seems consistent.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap: Recognize that both expressions inside the square roots are perfect squares, take their absolute values considering the given inequalities, and then simplify the expression accordingly. Yep, that should do it.\n</think>\n\nThe expression simplifies to \\(-2m\\).",

    "problem": "Given the function $f(x) = \\ln(ax-1)$, its derivative is $f'(x)$, and $f'(2) = 2$, find the value of the real number $a$. Express your answer as a fraction or decimal.",
    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of 'a' in the function f(x) = ln(ax - 1). They also told me that the derivative of this function at x = 2 is 2, which is f'(2) = 2. Hmm, let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that to find the derivative of a natural logarithm function, there's a standard rule. The derivative of ln(u) with respect to x is (u')/u, where u is a function of x. So in this case, u would be ax - 1, right? So I think I can apply that rule here.\n\nLet me write down the function again: f(x) = ln(ax - 1). To find f'(x), I need to differentiate this with respect to x. Using the chain rule, the derivative of ln(u) is (1/u) * du/dx. So here, u = ax - 1, so du/dx would be the derivative of ax - 1 with respect to x, which is just 'a', since the derivative of ax is a and the derivative of -1 is 0.\n\nPutting that together, f'(x) should be (a)/(ax - 1). That makes sense because the chain rule tells us to multiply by the derivative of the inside function, which is 'a' in this case.\n\nNow, the problem gives me that f'(2) = 2. So I can plug x = 2 into the derivative I just found. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, substitute x = 2 into the derivative expression: f'(2) = a / (a*2 - 1). According to the problem, this equals 2. So I can set up the equation:\n\na / (2a - 1) = 2\n\nNow, I need to solve this equation for 'a'. Let's write that out:\n\na / (2a - 1) = 2\n\nTo solve for 'a', I can cross-multiply. So multiplying both sides by (2a - 1), I get:\n\na = 2*(2a - 1)\n\nLet me expand the right side:\n\na = 4a - 2\n\nHmm, now I have an equation with 'a' on both sides. Let's get all the 'a' terms on one side. Subtract 4a from both sides:\n\na - 4a = -2\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n-3a = -2\n\nNow, divide both sides by -3:\n\na = (-2)/(-3) = 2/3\n\nSo, a is 2/3. Let me just double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nPlugging a = 2/3 back into the derivative expression f'(x) = a/(ax - 1). So f'(x) = (2/3)/( (2/3)x - 1 ). Now, evaluate at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = (2/3)/( (2/3)*2 - 1 ) = (2/3)/(4/3 - 1) = (2/3)/(1/3) = 2/3 * 3/1 = 2\n\nYes, that works out. So f'(2) is indeed 2 when a is 2/3. Therefore, the value of 'a' is 2/3.\n\nI think that's correct. I followed the chain rule to find the derivative, set up the equation with the given value, solved for 'a', and then checked my answer by plugging it back in. Everything seems to check out.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( a \\), use the chain rule to differentiate \\( f(x) = \\ln(ax - 1) \\) and then evaluate the derivative at \\( x = 2 \\).

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that inequalities involving sums of squares often relate to well-known inequalities like the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or maybe the AM-QM inequality. But I'm not entirely sure which one applies here. Let me write down the inequality again to get a clearer picture:\n\n\\( (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 \\leq n(x^4 + y^4 + z^4) \\)\n\nI need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that this holds for any real \\( x, y, z \\).

Maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality here, which states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.\n\nBut before that, perhaps I can consider normalizing the variables. Since the inequality is homogeneous, I can assume without loss of generality that \\( x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 1 \\).

Let me set up the function:\n\nLet \\( f(x, y, z) = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 \\) and the constraint \\( g(x, y, z) = x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - 1 = 0 \\).\n\nThe method of Lagrange multipliers tells me that at the maximum, the gradient of \\( f \\) is proportional to the gradient of \\( g \\). So,\n\n\\( \\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g \\)\n\nCalculating the gradients:\n\n\\( \\nabla f = (4x(x^2 + y^2 + z^2), 4y(x^2 + y^2 + z^2), 4z(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)) \\)\n\n\\( \\nabla g = (4x^3, 4y^3, 4z^3) \\)\n\nSetting them proportional:\n\n\\( 4x(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = \\lambda 4x^3 \\)\n\nSimilarly for the other components:\n\n\\( 4y(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = \\lambda 4y^3 \\)\n\n\\( 4z(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = \\lambda 4z^3 \\)\n\nSimplifying each equation:\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n\\( x(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = \\lambda x^3 \\)\n\nSimilarly:\n\n\\( y(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = \\lambda y^3 \\)\n\n\\( z(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = \\lambda z^3 \\)\n\nAssuming \\( x, y, z \\neq 0 \\), we can divide both sides by \\( x, y, z \\) respectively:\n\n\\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \\lambda x^2 \\)\n\n\\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \\lambda y^2 \\)\n\n\\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \\lambda z^2 \\)\n\nSo, from these equations, we have:\n\n\\( \\lambda x^2 = \\lambda y^2 = \\lambda z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\)\n\nAssuming \\( \\lambda \\neq 0 \\), we can write:\n\n\\( x^2 = y^2 = z^2 \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = k \\). Then, since \\( x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 1 \\), we have:\n\n\\( 3k^2 = 1 \\) => \\( k^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\) => \\( k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\). Then, \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\sqrt{3} \\)\n\nSo, \\( (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 = (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 3 \\)\n\nBut wait, if \\( x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\), then \\( x^4 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\), so \\( x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 1 \\), which satisfies the constraint.\n\nSo, the maximum value of \\( (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 \\) under the constraint is 3. Therefore, \\( n \\) must be at least 3.\n\nBut I need to check if this is indeed the maximum. Maybe there's a case where two variables are equal and the third is zero, or something like that, which might give a higher value.\n\nLet me test the case where one variable is zero. Suppose \\( z = 0 \\), then the inequality becomes \\( (x^2 + y^2)^2 \\leq n(x^4 + y^4) \\). Let me see what the maximum of \\( (x^2 + y^2)^2 / (x^4 + y^4) \\) is.\n\nLet me set \\( t = x^2 \\) and \\( s = y^2 \\). Then, the expression becomes \\( (t + s)^2 / (t^2 + s^2) \\). Let me compute this:\n\n\\( (t + s)^2 / (t^2 + s^2) = (t^2 + 2ts + s^2) / (t^2 + s^2) = 1 + (2ts)/(t^2 + s^2) \\)\n\nSince \\( t \\) and \\( s \\) are non-negative, the term \\( (2ts)/(t^2 + s^2) \\) is always less than or equal to 1, by AM-GM inequality because \\( t^2 + s^2 \\geq 2ts \\), so \\( 2ts/(t^2 + s^2) \\leq 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( (t + s)^2 / (t^2 + s^2) \\leq 2 \\). So, in this case, the maximum ratio is 2.\n\nBut earlier, when all variables are equal, we got a ratio of 3. So, 3 is larger than 2, which suggests that the maximum occurs when all variables are equal.\n\nWait, but in this case, when z = 0, we have a maximum ratio of 2, which is less than 3. So, the maximum is indeed 3, achieved when all variables are equal.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the case when two variables are equal and the third is different. Let me suppose \\( x = y \\) and \\( z \\) is different.\n\nLet me set \\( x = y = a \\) and \\( z = b \\). Then, the constraint becomes \\( 2a^4 + b^4 = 1 \\). The expression to maximize is \\( (2a^2 + b^2)^2 \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( u = a^2 \\) and \\( v = b^2 \\). Then, the constraint is \\( 2u^2 + v^2 = 1 \\), and the expression becomes \\( (2u + v)^2 \\).\n\nI need to maximize \\( (2u + v)^2 \\) given \\( 2u^2 + v^2 = 1 \\) and \\( u, v \\geq 0 \\).\n\nLet me set \\( v = t \\), so \\( 2u^2 = 1 - t^2 \\), hence \\( u = \\sqrt{(1 - t^2)/2} \\).\n\nThen, the expression becomes \\( (2\\sqrt{(1 - t^2)/2} + t)^2 \\). Let me simplify this:\n\nFirst, \\( 2\\sqrt{(1 - t^2)/2} = \\sqrt{4 \\times (1 - t^2)/2} = \\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} \\)\n\nSo, the expression is \\( (\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} + t)^2 \\). Let me expand this:\n\n\\( 2(1 - t^2) + 2t\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} + t^2 = 2 - 2t^2 + t^2 + 2t\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} = 2 - t^2 + 2t\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} \\)\n\nTo find the maximum of this expression with respect to \\( t \\) in [0, 1], since \\( v = t \\geq 0 \\) and \\( 2u^2 + v^2 = 1 \\) implies \\( t \\leq 1 \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( f(t) = 2 - t^2 + 2t\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} \\). To find its maximum, I can take the derivative and set it to zero.\n\nCompute \\( f'(t) \\):\n\n\\( f'(t) = -2t + 2\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} + 2t \\times \\frac{d}{dt}\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} \\)\n\nCompute the derivative inside:\n\n\\( \\frac{d}{dt}\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)}} \\times (-4t) = \\frac{-2t}{\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)}} \\)\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n\\( f'(t) = -2t + 2\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} + 2t \\times \\left( \\frac{-2t}{\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)}} \\right) \\)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: \\( -2t \\)\n\nSecond term: \\( 2\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} \\)\n\nThird term: \\( -4t^2 / \\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( f'(t) = -2t + 2\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} - \\frac{4t^2}{\\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)}} \\)\n\nLet me factor out \\( \\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} \\) from the second and third terms:\n\n\\( f'(t) = -2t + \\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} \\left( 2 - \\frac{4t^2}{2(1 - t^2)} \\right) \\)\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n\\( 2 - \\frac{4t^2}{2(1 - t^2)} = 2 - \\frac{2t^2}{1 - t^2} = \\frac{2(1 - t^2) - 2t^2}{1 - t^2} = \\frac{2 - 4t^2}{1 - t^2} \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( f'(t) = -2t + \\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} \\times \\frac{2 - 4t^2}{1 - t^2} \\)\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nNote that \\( \\sqrt{2(1 - t^2)} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{1 - t^2} \\), so:\n\n\\( f'(t) = -2t + \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{1 - t^2} \\times \\frac{2 - 4t^2}{1 - t^2} \\)\n\n\\( = -2t + \\sqrt{2} \\times \\frac{2 - 4t^2}{\\sqrt{1 - t^2}} \\)\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe instead of taking derivatives, I can consider specific values of \\( t \\) to see where the maximum occurs.\n\nLet me test \\( t = 0 \\):\n\n\\( f(0) = 2 - 0 + 0 = 2 \\)\n\n\\( t = 1 \\):\n\n\\( f(1) = 2 - 1 + 2 \\times 1 \\times \\sqrt{2(1 - 1)} = 1 + 0 = 1 \\)\n\nWhat about \\( t = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\):\n\n\\( t = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.707 \\)\n\nThen,\n\n\\( f(t) = 2 - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + 2 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)} \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 2 - 0.5 + \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{1} = 1.5 + \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.5 + 1.414 \\approx 2.914 \\)\n\nWhich is less than 3.\n\nWait, but when all variables are equal, we had \\( (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 = 3 \\). So, maybe in this case, when two variables are equal and the third is zero, the maximum is around 2.914, which is still less than 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when one variable is non-zero and the other two are zero. Let me check that case.\n\nSuppose \\( y = z = 0 \\). Then the inequality becomes \\( x^4 \\leq n x^4 \\), so \\( 1 \\leq n \\). So, \\( n \\geq 1 \\). But we already have a higher value when variables are equal.\n\nSo, from these cases, it seems that the maximum occurs when all variables are equal, giving \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nWait, but let me test another case where two variables are equal and the third is non-zero but not equal. Maybe \\( x = y \\neq z \\).\n\nLet me assume \\( x = y = a \\) and \\( z = b \\), with \\( a \\neq b \\). Then, the constraint is \\( 2a^4 + b^4 = 1 \\), and the expression to maximize is \\( (2a^2 + b^2)^2 \\).\n\nLet me set \\( a = b \\). Then, we have \\( 3a^4 = 1 \\), so \\( a^4 = 1/3 \\), \\( a^2 = \\sqrt{1/3} \\), and \\( 2a^2 + b^2 = 3a^2 = \\sqrt{3} \\), so \\( (3a^2)^2 = 3 \\). Which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, let me try specific numbers. Let me set \\( x = y = 1 \\) and \\( z \\) such that \\( 2(1)^4 + z^4 = 1 \\). So, \\( z^4 = -1 \\), which is impossible. So, I can't set \\( x = y = 1 \\). Instead, maybe set \\( x = y = k \\) and find \\( z \\) such that \\( 2k^4 + z^4 = 1 \\).\n\nLet me choose \\( k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{2}} \\), so \\( k^4 = \\frac{1}{2} \\), then \\( z^4 = 0 \\), so \\( z = 0 \\). Then, \\( (2k^2 + 0)^2 = (2 \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \\), which is less than 3.\n\nAlternatively, let me set \\( k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), so \\( k^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\), \\( k^4 = \\frac{1}{4} \\). Then, \\( 2k^4 = \\frac{1}{2} \\), so \\( z^4 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\), so \\( z^2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). Then, \\( 2k^2 + z^2 = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} +",

    "problem": "A leak in the bottom of a tank can empty the full tank in 3 hours. There are two inlet pipes which can fill the tank. Inlet Pipe A fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, while Inlet Pipe B fills the tank at a rate of 4 litres a minute. Both inlet pipes are opened simultaneously when the tank is full, and due to the leak, the tank is empty in 12 hours. How many litres does the cistern hold?",
    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many litres the cistern holds. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a leak that can empty the full tank in 3 hours. That means the leak's rate is 1/3 of the tank per hour. But since we're dealing with litres, maybe it's better to express the leak's rate in litres per hour once we know the capacity.\n\nNext, there are two inlet pipes. Pipe A fills at 6 litres per minute, and Pipe B at 4 litres per minute. So together, they fill at 10 litres per minute. To find the combined rate in litres per hour, I multiply by 60: 10 * 60 = 600 litres per hour.\n\nNow, both pipes are opened at the same time when the tank is full, and the tank empties in 12 hours due to the leak. So the net effect is that the tank is being filled and then emptied over time.\n\nLet me denote the capacity of the tank as C litres. \n\nIn 12 hours, Pipe A and B together would have added 600 * 12 = 7200 litres. But since the tank is emptying at the same time, the leak would have removed C litres in 12 hours. Wait, no, the leak's rate is dependent on the capacity. Actually, the leak's rate is C/3 litres per hour because it takes 3 hours to empty the tank.\n\nSo over 12 hours, the leak would have removed (C/3) * 12 = 4C litres.\n\nBut the tank started full, so the total water added by the pipes is 7200 litres, and the total water lost due to the leak is 4C litres. Since the tank ends up empty, the water added minus the water lost should equal the capacity C.\n\nSo, 7200 - 4C = C\n\nSolving for C: 7200 = 5C \u2192 C = 7200 / 5 = 1440 litres.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. The leak's rate is C/3 per hour, so in 12 hours, it's 4C. The inflow is 600 per hour, so in 12 hours, 7200. The net change is outflow equals inflow, so 7200 - 4C = C, leading to C=1440. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe tank's capacity can be found by considering the rates of the pipes and the leak. Let\u2019s denote the capacity as \\( C \\) litres. The leak empties the tank at a rate of \\( \\frac{C}{3} \\) litres per hour, while the two pipes together fill at \\( 10 \\) litres per minute, or \\( 600 \\) litres per hour. Over \\( 12 \\) hours, the net effect is that the tank is filled and then emptied, leading to the equation \\( 600 \\times 12 - \\frac{C}{3} \\times 12 = C \\). Solving this gives \\( C = 1440 \\) litres.",

    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(2 \\sqrt{x} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{x}}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), each term in the expansion is given by the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, in this case, \\(a\\) is \\(2\\sqrt{x}\\), \\(b\\) is \\(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{x}}\\), and \\(n\\) is 6.\n\nSo, the general term in the expansion would be \\(\\binom{6}{k} (2\\sqrt{x})^{6 - k} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{x}}\\right)^k\\). I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(x\\) is zero because that's the constant term.\n\nLet me write that out more clearly. Each term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} \\times (2)^{6 - k} \\times (\\sqrt{x})^{6 - k} \\times (-1)^k \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{x}}\\right)^k\\).\n\nSimplifying the exponents, I know that \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) is \\(x^{1/2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{x}}\\) is \\(x^{-1/4}\\). So, substituting these in, the term becomes:\n\n\\(\\binom{6}{k} \\times 2^{6 - k} \\times (-1)^k \\times x^{\\frac{6 - k}{2}} \\times x^{-\\frac{k}{4}}\\).\n\nNow, combining the exponents of \\(x\\), I add the two fractions: \\(\\frac{6 - k}{2} - \\frac{k}{4}\\). To combine them, I need a common denominator, which is 4. So, that becomes \\(\\frac{12 - 2k}{4} - \\frac{k}{4} = \\frac{12 - 3k}{4}\\).\n\nI need this exponent to be zero for the term to be constant. So, I set up the equation:\n\n\\(\\frac{12 - 3k}{4} = 0\\).\n\nSolving for \\(k\\), multiply both sides by 4: \\(12 - 3k = 0\\). Then, \\(12 = 3k\\), so \\(k = 4\\).\n\nAlright, so the constant term is the term when \\(k = 4\\). Let me compute that term now.\n\nFirst, the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{4}\\). I know that \\(\\binom{6}{4} = \\binom{6}{2} = 15\\) because \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n - k}\\).\n\nNext, \\(2^{6 - 4} = 2^2 = 4\\).\n\nThen, \\((-1)^4 = 1\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the constant term is \\(15 \\times 4 \\times 1 \\times x^0\\), which is just \\(15 \\times 4 = 60\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that exponent calculation. When \\(k = 4\\), the exponent is \\(\\frac{12 - 3(4)}{4} = \\frac{12 - 12}{4} = 0\\). Yep, that's correct. So, the constant term is indeed 60.\n\nI think that's it. The key was to set the exponent equal to zero and solve for \\(k\\), then plug that value back into the general term formula to find the constant term. I also had to remember how to handle negative exponents and fractional exponents, converting them into fractions to combine them properly.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems straightforward once I break it down step by step. So, the constant term is 60.\n</think>\n\nThe constant term is found by identifying when the exponent of \\(x\\) equals zero in the binomial expansion. After calculating, the constant term is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{60}\\)",

    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest possible value of the expression \\( \\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy \\) where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive real numbers. Hmm, I remember from my math classes that when dealing with expressions that involve variables in both the numerator and denominator, calculus might be useful, especially taking derivatives to find minima or maxima. Alternatively, maybe the AM-GM inequality could help since it's often useful for optimization problems with positive variables.\n\nLet me think about the AM-GM approach first. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. So, if I can express the terms in such a way that I have a sum of terms with a fixed product, I can apply AM-GM. \n\nLooking at the expression \\( \\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy \\), I notice it has three terms. The first two are fractions with \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the denominators, and the last term is a product of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Maybe I can split these terms into more parts to apply AM-GM effectively. \n\nAlternatively, since there are two variables, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), I might need to use partial derivatives with respect to each variable to find the critical points where the expression reaches its minimum. That would involve setting the partial derivatives equal to zero and solving the resulting system of equations.\n\nLet me try the calculus approach first. I'll treat \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) as independent variables and find the partial derivatives of the function \\( f(x, y) = \\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy \\).\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to \\( x \\) would be:\n\\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{16}{x^2} + y \\)\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to \\( y \\) would be:\n\\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{108}{y^2} + x \\)\n\nTo find the critical points, I'll set both partial derivatives equal to zero:\n1. \\( -\\frac{16}{x^2} + y = 0 \\) \u21d2 \\( y = \\frac{16}{x^2} \\)\n2. \\( -\\frac{108}{y^2} + x = 0 \\) \u21d2 \\( x = \\frac{108}{y^2} \\)\n\nNow, substitute equation 1 into equation 2:\n\\( x = \\frac{108}{\\left(\\frac{16}{x^2}\\right)^2} \\)\nSimplify the denominator:\n\\( \\left(\\frac{16}{x^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{256}{x^4} \\)\nSo,\n\\( x = \\frac{108}{\\frac{256}{x^4}} = \\frac{108 x^4}{256} \\)\nSimplify the fraction:\n\\( \\frac{108}{256} = \\frac{27}{64} \\)\nSo,\n\\( x = \\frac{27}{64} x^4 \\)\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\\( 64x = 27x^4 \\)\nDivide both sides by x (since x \u2260 0):\n\\( 64 = 27x^3 \\)\nSolve for x:\n\\( x^3 = \\frac{64}{27} \\)\nTake the cube root:\n\\( x = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{64}{27}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\)\n\nNow, plug x back into equation 1 to find y:\n\\( y = \\frac{16}{(\\frac{4}{3})^2} = \\frac{16}{\\frac{16}{9}} = 9 \\)\n\nSo, the critical point is at \\( x = \\frac{4}{3} \\) and \\( y = 9 \\). Now, to ensure this is a minimum, I can check the second partial derivatives or consider the behavior of the function, but since it's a positive expression and the function tends to infinity as x or y approach 0 or infinity, it's safe to assume this is the minimum.\n\nNow, plug these values back into the original expression to find the minimal value:\n\\( \\frac{16}{\\frac{4}{3}} + \\frac{108}{9} + \\frac{4}{3} \\times 9 \\)\nCalculate each term:\n- \\( \\frac{16}{\\frac{4}{3}} = 16 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 12 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{108}{9} = 12 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\times 9 = 12 \\)\nAdding them up: 12 + 12 + 12 = 36\n\nWait, that's 36. But I thought maybe AM-GM could give a quicker solution. Let me try that approach to see if I can get the same answer without calculus.\n\nLooking at the expression \\( \\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy \\), I want to apply AM-GM. But AM-GM works best when the terms are positive and their product is a constant or can be manipulated to form a constant. \n\nI have three terms: \\( \\frac{16}{x} \\), \\( \\frac{108}{y} \\), and \\( xy \\). Let me see if I can split these into more terms to apply AM-GM. Maybe I can consider the terms as multiple parts so that when multiplied together, they give a constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the method of weighted AM-GM or consider the terms in a way that allows me to balance the variables.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps consider the expression as the sum of three terms and apply AM-GM directly. Let's see:\n\nThe AM-GM inequality for three positive numbers a, b, c states that \\( \\frac{a + b + c}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{abc} \\). So, if I set \\( a = \\frac{16}{x} \\), \\( b = \\frac{108}{y} \\), and \\( c = xy \\), then:\n\n\\( \\frac{\\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{16}{x} \\times \\frac{108}{y} \\times xy} \\)\n\nSimplify the product inside the cube root:\n\\( \\frac{16 \\times 108 \\times x y}{x y} = 16 \\times 108 = 1728 \\)\nSo,\n\\( \\sqrt[3]{1728} = 12 \\)\nThus,\n\\( \\frac{\\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy}{3} \\geq 12 \\)\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\\( \\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy \\geq 36 \\)\n\nSo, the minimal value is 36, achieved when \\( \\frac{16}{x} = \\frac{108}{y} = xy \\). Let me check if this aligns with the values I found earlier.\n\nFrom the equality condition in AM-GM, all terms must be equal:\n\\( \\frac{16}{x} = \\frac{108}{y} = xy \\)\n\nLet me set \\( \\frac{16}{x} = xy \\) and \\( \\frac{108}{y} = xy \\).\n\nFrom \\( \\frac{16}{x} = xy \\), we get \\( y^2 = \\frac{16}{x^2} \\) \u21d2 \\( y = \\frac{4}{x} \\).\n\nFrom \\( \\frac{108}{y} = xy \\), substitute \\( y = \\frac{4}{x} \\):\n\\( \\frac{108}{\\frac{4}{x}} = x \\times \\frac{4}{x} \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( 108 \\times \\frac{x}{4} = 4 \\)\n\\( 27x = 4 \\)\nWait, that's \\( x = \\frac{4}{27} \\), which contradicts the earlier value of \\( x = \\frac{4}{3} \\). Hmm, that doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the AM-GM approach. Maybe I split the terms differently. Alternatively, perhaps the expression can be split into more than three terms to make the AM-GM applicable correctly.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe split the \\( \\frac{16}{x} \\) and \\( \\frac{108}{y} \\) terms into multiple terms so that when I apply AM-GM, the product of all terms becomes a constant.\n\nLet me consider \\( \\frac{16}{x} \\) as four terms of \\( \\frac{4}{x} \\) each, and \\( \\frac{108}{y} \\) as nine terms of \\( \\frac{12}{y} \\) each. Then, along with the \\( xy \\) term, I have a total of 4 + 9 + 1 = 14 terms. Then, applying AM-GM on these 14 terms.\n\nWait, that might complicate things, but let me try.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\\( 4 \\times \\frac{4}{x} + 9 \\times \\frac{12}{y} + xy \\)\n\nNow, applying AM-GM on these 14 terms:\n\\( \\frac{4 \\times \\frac{4}{x} + 9 \\times \\frac{12}{y} + xy}{14} \\geq \\sqrt[14]{\\left(\\frac{4}{x}\\right)^4 \\times \\left(\\frac{12}{y}\\right)^9 \\times xy} \\)\n\nSimplify the product inside the root:\n\\( \\left(\\frac{4}{x}\\right)^4 = \\frac{256}{x^4} \\)\n\\( \\left(\\frac{12}{y}\\right)^9 = \\frac{12^9}{y^9} \\)\n\\( xy \\) remains as is.\n\nMultiply them together:\n\\( \\frac{256}{x^4} \\times \\frac{12^9}{y^9} \\times xy = \\frac{256 \\times 12^9 \\times x y}{x^4 y^9} = \\frac{256 \\times 12^9}{x^3 y^8} \\)\n\nThis seems messy, and I don't see an easy way to make this a constant. Maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can split \\( xy \\) into two terms, like \\( \\frac{xy}{2} + \\frac{xy}{2} \\), so that I have a total of 5 terms: 4 terms of \\( \\frac{4}{x} \\), 9 terms of \\( \\frac{12}{y} \\), and 2 terms of \\( \\frac{xy}{2} \\). Then, applying AM-GM on 15 terms.\n\nBut this seems too complicated, and I might not get a clean result. Maybe sticking with the initial calculus approach was better.\n\nWait, let me go back to the AM-GM approach with the three terms. The problem was that when I set \\( \\frac{16}{x} = \\frac{108}{y} = xy \\), I got inconsistent results. Let me solve it again carefully.\n\nFrom \\( \\frac{16}{x} = xy \\), we have \\( y^2 = \\frac{16}{x^2} \\) \u21d2 \\( y = \\frac{4}{x} \\).\n\nFrom \\( \\frac{108}{y} = xy \\), substitute \\( y = \\frac{4}{x} \\):\n\\( \\frac{108}{\\frac{4}{x}} = x \\times \\frac{4}{x} \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( 108 \\times \\frac{x}{4} = 4 \\)\n\\( 27x = 4 \\)\n\\( x = \\frac{4}{27} \\)\n\nWait, but earlier using calculus, I found \\( x = \\frac{4}{3} \\). These two results don't match. That means I must have made a mistake in applying AM-GM. Maybe the equality conditions aren't met correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the way I split the terms isn't appropriate.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to split the terms differently. Let me try splitting \\( \\frac{16}{x} \\) into two terms and \\( \\frac{108}{y} \\) into three terms, along with \\( xy \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider \\( \\frac{16}{x} \\) as four terms of \\( \\frac{4}{x} \\) and \\( \\frac{108}{y} \\) as nine terms of \\( \\frac{12}{y} \\), and then apply AM-GM on all 14 terms plus \\( xy \\). But this seems too cumbersome.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but that's essentially similar to the calculus approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express y in terms of x or vice versa and then find the minimum of a single-variable function.\n\nLet me try that. From the first partial derivative, I had \\( y = \\frac{16}{x^2} \\). Substitute this into the second partial derivative equation, which was \\( x = \\frac{108}{y^2} \\).\n\nSo, \\( x = \\frac{108}{\\left(\\frac{16}{x^2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{108}{\\frac{256}{x^4}} = \\frac{108 x^4}{256} = \\frac{27 x^4}{64} \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = \\frac{27 x^4}{64} \\) \u21d2 \\( 64x = 27x^4 \\) \u21d2 \\( 27x^4 - 64x = 0 \\) \u21d2 \\( x(27x^3 - 64) = 0 \\)\n\nSince x > 0, \\( x = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{64}{27}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\), which matches the calculus result. Then, \\( y = \\frac{16}{(\\frac{4}{3})^2} = \\frac{16}{\\frac{16}{9}} = 9 \\).\n\nSo, the minimal value is \\( \\frac{16}{\\frac{4}{3}} + \\frac{108}{9} + \\frac{4}{3} \\times 9 = 12 + 12 + 12 = 36 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality by considering the expression as the sum of \\( \\frac{16}{x} \\), \\( \\frac{108}{y} \\), and \\( xy \\), and find a way to balance the terms so that their product is a constant, allowing me to apply AM-GM.\n\nWait, another idea: Let's consider the terms \\( \\frac{16}{x} \\), \\( \\frac{108}{y} \\), and \\( xy \\) and try to find a relationship between them. From the calculus approach, we saw that at the minimum, \\( \\frac{16}{x} = xy \\) and \\( \\frac{108}{y} = xy \\). So, \\( \\frac{16}{x} = \\frac{108}{y} \\), which gives \\( \\frac{16}{x} = \\frac{108}{y} \\) \u21d2 \\( 16y = 108x \\) \u21d2 \\( y = \\frac{108}{16}x = \\frac{27}{4}x \\).\n\nSo, \\( y = \\frac{27}{4}x \\). Now, substitute this into \\( xy \\):\n\\( xy = x \\times \\frac{27}{4}x = \\frac{27}{4}x^2 \\)\n\nFrom \\( \\frac{16}{x} = xy \\), we have \\( \\frac{16}{x} = \\frac{27}{4}x^2 \\) \u21d2 \\( \\frac{16}{x} = \\frac{27}{4}x^2 \\) \u21d2 Multiply both sides by x:\n\\( 16 = \\frac{27}{4}x^3 \\) \u21d2 \\( x^3 = \\frac{16 \\times 4}{27} = \\frac{64}{27} \\) \u21d2 \\( x = \\frac{4}{3} \\), which matches the calculus result. Then, \\( y = \\frac{27}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 9 \\).\n\nSo, this confirms that the minimal value is 36.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to express the entire expression in terms of one variable and then find the minimum. Let's try that.\n\nFrom \\( y = \\frac{27}{4}x \\), substitute into the expression:\n\\( f(x) = \\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy = \\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{\\frac{27}{4}x} + x \\times \\frac{27}{4}x \\)\nSimplify each term:\n- \\( \\frac{108}{\\frac{27}{4}x} = 108 \\times \\frac{4}{27x} = \\frac{432}{27x} = \\frac{16}{x} \\)\n- \\( x \\times \\frac{27}{4}x = \\frac{27}{4}x^2 \\)\n\nSo, \\( f(x) = \\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{27}{4}x^2 = \\frac{32}{x} + \\frac{27}{4",

    "problem": "Taylor's house guests have different preferences for coffee in the morning. Half of them like weak coffee and the other half like strong coffee. Taylor uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water to make it weak and he changes the amount for strong coffee. If he makes 12 cups of both weak and strong coffee and needs 36 tablespoons of coffee, what is the ratio of the amount of coffee used for strong coffee to the amount used for weak coffee?",
    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I have this problem about Taylor's house guests and their coffee preferences. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that half of Taylor's guests like weak coffee and the other half like strong coffee. So, if there are, say, 24 guests in total, 12 would prefer weak and 12 would prefer strong. But actually, the problem doesn't give the total number of guests, so maybe I don't need that information. Instead, it mentions that Taylor makes 12 cups of both weak and strong coffee. So that's 12 cups of weak and 12 cups of strong.\n\nNext, it says that Taylor uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water to make weak coffee. So for each cup of weak coffee, he uses 1 tablespoon. That means for 12 cups, he would use 12 tablespoons of coffee.\n\nNow, he changes the amount for strong coffee. So, for each cup of strong coffee, he uses more than 1 tablespoon. Let's call the amount of coffee he uses per cup of strong coffee as 'x' tablespoons. Therefore, for 12 cups of strong coffee, he would use 12x tablespoons.\n\nThe total amount of coffee he uses is 36 tablespoons. So, the sum of the coffee used for weak and strong should equal 36. That means 12 tablespoons (for weak) plus 12x tablespoons (for strong) equals 36.\n\nPutting that into an equation: 12 + 12x = 36.\n\nI need to solve for x, which is the tablespoons of coffee per cup for strong coffee. Once I find x, the ratio of strong coffee to weak coffee would be (12x) : (12). Simplifying that ratio would give me the answer.\n\nSo, solving the equation: 12 + 12x = 36. Subtract 12 from both sides: 12x = 24. Divide both sides by 12: x = 2. So, he uses 2 tablespoons per cup for strong coffee.\n\nTherefore, the amount used for strong is 12 * 2 = 24 tablespoons, and for weak it's 12 * 1 = 12 tablespoons. The ratio is 24:12, which simplifies to 2:1.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio of the amount of coffee used for strong to weak. So, it's 24:12, which reduces to 2:1. So the ratio is 2 to 1.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just double-check my steps. I set up the equation correctly, solved for x, and then calculated the amounts. The ratio simplifies correctly. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, focus on setting up an equation based on the total tablespoons of coffee used and the ratio of weak to strong coffee consumption. Once you find the tablespoons per cup for strong coffee, you can determine the desired ratio.",

    "problem": "Three students each choose one day from Saturday or Sunday to participate in a charity event. Calculate the probability that there will be students participating on both Saturday and Sunday. Express your answer as a simplified fraction.",
    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I have this probability problem where three students each pick a day\u2014either Saturday or Sunday\u2014to participate in a charity event. I need to find the probability that there are students on both days. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that probability often involves figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I should probably start by determining how many total possible ways the students can choose their days.\n\nEach student has two choices: Saturday or Sunday. Since there are three students, the total number of possible combinations would be 2 multiplied by itself three times, right? That's 2^3, which is 8. So, there are 8 possible ways the students can choose their days.\n\nNow, I need to find how many of these 8 possibilities result in both Saturday and Sunday being chosen by at least one student each. Instead of counting those directly, maybe it's easier to calculate the opposite probability and subtract it from 1. The opposite event would be all students choosing the same day, either all Saturday or all Sunday.\n\nHow many ways can all students choose the same day? Well, there are two such cases: all choose Saturday or all choose Sunday. So that's 2 favorable outcomes for the opposite event.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes for both days being chosen is the total outcomes minus the opposite outcomes. So, 8 total - 2 all-same = 6. That means there are 6 favorable outcomes where both days are covered.\n\nSo, the probability is the number of favorable divided by total, which is 6/8. Simplifying that fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 2 gives 3/4.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If I list all possible combinations, would that make sense? Let's see:\n\n1. All Saturday: S, S, S\n2. All Sunday: S, S, S (Wait, no, that's the same as the first one. Maybe I should think of each student's choice as S or Su. So, each can be S or Su.)\n\nActually, listing all 8 possibilities:\n\n1. S, S, S\n2. S, S, Su\n3. S, Su, S\n4. S, Su, Su\n5. Su, S, S\n6. Su, S, Su\n7. Su, Su, S\n8. Su, Su, Su\n\nNow, out of these 8, the ones where both days are present are from 2 to 7. That's 6 outcomes, which matches my earlier calculation. So, yes, 6/8 simplifies to 3/4. So, the probability is 3/4.\n\nI think that makes sense because as the number of students increases, the chance that both days are covered increases too. With three students, it's quite likely that both days are chosen, hence the high probability.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The probability that at least one student chooses Saturday plus the probability that at least one chooses Sunday minus the probability that at least one chooses both. Wait, no, that might complicate things more. The first method seems straightforward.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability is 3/4.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that there will be students participating on both Saturday and Sunday is 3/4.",

    "teacher_hint": "Alright, so I have this problem about an ellipse, and I need to find the distance from a point P on the ellipse to the other focus, given that the distance to one focus is 3. Hmm, okay, let me think about what I remember about ellipses.\n\nFirst, the standard equation of an ellipse is \\(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\), where \\(a\\) is the semi-major axis and \\(b\\) is the semi-minor axis. In this problem, the equation is \\(\\frac{x^2}{25} + \\frac{y^2}{16} = 1\\), so that means \\(a^2 = 25\\) and \\(b^2 = 16\\). Therefore, \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = 4\\). \n\nNow, I recall that for an ellipse, the distance from the center to each focus is given by \\(c\\), where \\(c^2 = a^2 - b^2\\). Let me calculate that. So, \\(c^2 = 25 - 16 = 9\\), which means \\(c = 3\\). So, the foci are located at \\((\\pm 3, 0)\\) on the x-axis because the major axis is along the x-axis since \\(a^2\\) is under the x-term.\n\nOkay, so the two foci are at (3, 0) and (-3, 0). The problem says that the distance from point P to one focus is 3. I need to find the distance from P to the other focus.\n\nWait a second, I remember a key property of ellipses: the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to the major axis length, which is \\(2a\\). So, that sum should be \\(2a = 2*5 = 10\\). \n\nSo, if the distance from P to one focus is 3, then the distance to the other focus must be \\(10 - 3 = 7\\). That seems straightforward. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\nWait, is there a possibility that point P is such that the distance to one focus is 3, but the other distance isn't just 7? Hmm, no, because the sum is always 10. So, regardless of where P is on the ellipse, as long as it's on the ellipse, the sum of the distances to the two foci is 10. So, if one is 3, the other has to be 7.\n\nI think that's it. So, the distance from P to the other focus is 7.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is equal to the major axis length, which is \\(2a\\). Since \\(a = 5\\), the sum is 10. Given one distance is 3, the other must be \\(10 - 3 = 7\\).\n\n**Answer:** 7",

    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I have this problem where the point (8,4) is on the graph of the function f(x) = 1 + log_a(x). I need to find the inverse function of f(x). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since the point (8,4) is on the graph, that means when x is 8, f(x) is 4. So I can plug these values into the equation to find the base 'a' of the logarithm. Let me write that down: 4 = 1 + log_a(8). \n\nWait, solving for 'a' might be necessary because the inverse function will depend on it. So I can subtract 1 from both sides to get log_a(8) = 3. That means a^3 = 8. Hmm, so what number raised to the power of 3 is 8? Oh, that's 2, because 2^3 = 8. So 'a' must be 2. Got it, so the function is f(x) = 1 + log_2(x).\n\nNow, to find the inverse function, I remember that the inverse function essentially swaps the x and y values. So if f(x) is y = 1 + log_2(x), the inverse would be x = 1 + log_2(y). I need to solve this equation for y.\n\nLet me subtract 1 from both sides: x - 1 = log_2(y). To get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. Remember that log_b(c) = d is equivalent to b^d = c. So applying that here, 2^(x - 1) = y. Therefore, the inverse function f^{-1}(x) = 2^(x - 1).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I start with y = 1 + log_2(x), then to find the inverse, swap x and y: x = 1 + log_2(y). Subtract 1: x - 1 = log_2(y). Exponentiate both sides with base 2: 2^(x - 1) = y. Yep, that looks right.\n\nSo the inverse function is f^{-1}(x) = 2^(x - 1). I think that's it. I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes in solving for 'a' and in finding the inverse function. Let me verify with the point given. If f(8) = 4, then the inverse function should satisfy f^{-1}(4) = 8. Plugging into my inverse function: 2^(4 - 1) = 2^3 = 8. Perfect, that checks out.

    "problem": "A polynomial of degree $13$ is divided by $d(x)$ to give a quotient of degree $7$ and a remainder of $3x^3+4x^2-x+12$. What is $\\deg d$?",
    "teacher_hint": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a polynomial of degree 13 is divided by another polynomial d(x), resulting in a quotient of degree 7 and a remainder of 3x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2 - x + 12. I need to figure out the degree of d(x). Hmm, let me think about how polynomial division works.\n\nI remember that when you divide a polynomial f(x) by another polynomial d(x), you get a quotient q(x) and a remainder r(x), such that f(x) = d(x) * q(x) + r(x). And the degree of the remainder r(x) has to be less than the degree of d(x). That makes sense because if the remainder had a higher degree, you could still divide it further by d(x).\n\nIn this problem, f(x) is a degree 13 polynomial. When we divide it by d(x), we get a quotient q(x) of degree 7 and a remainder r(x) which is a cubic polynomial (degree 3). So, from the equation f(x) = d(x) * q(x) + r(x), I can analyze the degrees.\n\nThe degree of f(x) is 13, which is equal to the degree of d(x) multiplied by the degree of q(x). Since q(x) is degree 7, that would mean the degree of d(x) times 7 equals 13. Wait, but 13 divided by 7 isn't an integer. That can't be right because degrees are whole numbers. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, no, actually, the degree of f(x) is the maximum of the degrees of d(x)*q(x) and r(x). Since the remainder r(x) has a lower degree than d(x), the degree of f(x) should be equal to the degree of d(x) multiplied by the degree of q(x). So, in this case, 13 = deg(d) * 7.\n\nBut 13 divided by 7 isn't an integer. That seems problematic. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. If f(x) = d(x) * q(x) + r(x), then the degree of f(x) is the maximum of the degrees of d(x)*q(x) and r(x). Since d(x) is of degree n and q(x) is of degree 7, the product d(x)*q(x) will be of degree n + 7. The remainder r(x) is degree 3, which is less than n because the remainder's degree must be less than the divisor's degree. So, the degree of f(x) is n + 7.\n\nGiven that f(x) is degree 13, so n + 7 = 13. Therefore, n = 13 - 7 = 6. So, the degree of d(x) is 6. That seems to make sense.\n\nWait, let me go through that again. So, f(x) is degree 13. When divided by d(x), quotient is degree 7, so d(x) must be of degree 6 because 7 + 6 = 13. Yeah, that adds up. The remainder is only degree 3, which is less than 6, so that works. So, the degree of d(x) is 6.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. The key is that when you divide two polynomials, the degree of the dividend is the sum of the degrees of the divisor and the quotient, provided the remainder's degree is less than the divisor's degree. So, in this case, 13 = deg(d) + 7, so deg(d) is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe degree of \\( d(x) \\) can be found by recognizing that the degree of the dividend equals the sum of the degrees of the divisor and the quotient. Thus, \\( \\deg(d) = 13 - 7 = 6 \\).\n\n\\boxed{6}",
