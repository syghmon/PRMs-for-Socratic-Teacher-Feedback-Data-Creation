The inequality $x + y \\geq A$  defines a region on this grid.\n\n3. **Increasing A:** As we increase the value of A, the region representing the solutions to the inequality shrinks.

Every point on the grid satisfies the inequality.  As you increase A, the region of solutions shrinks.

Understand the Relationship between Slope and Angle of Inclination**\n\nThe angle of inclination (\u03b1) of a line is the acute angle it makes with the positive x-axis.  The slope (m) of a line is directly related to its angle of inclination by the following equation:\n\n  tan(\u03b1) = m\n\n**2. Find the Slopes of the Lines**\n\n*  Line 1:  y = x + 1  has a slope (m\u2081) = 1\n*  Line 2:  y = -x + 1 has a slope (m\u2082) = -1\n*  Line 3:  y = -2x + 1 has a slope (m\u2083) = -2\n\n**3.  Determine the Angles of Inclination**\n\nUsing the arctangent function (tan\u207b\u00b9) to find the angles:\n\n* \u03b1\u2081 = tan\u207b\u00b9(m\u2081) = tan\u207b\u00b9(1) = 45\u00b0\n* \u03b1\u2082 = tan\u207b\u00b9(m\u2082) = tan\u207b\u00b9(-1) = -45\u00b0  (Since the slope is negative, the angle is measured below the x-axis)\n* \u03b1\u2083 = tan\u207b\u00b9(m\u2083) = tan\u207b\u00b9(-2)  \u2248 -63.4\u00b0\n\n**4. Arrange the Angles in Ascending Order**\n\nRemember that negative angles are measured clockwise from the positive x-axis.  Therefore, the angles in ascending order are:\n\n\u03b1\u2083 < \u03b1\u2082 < \u03b1\u2081 \n\n**Answer:**  \\boxed{\\alpha_3 < \\alpha_2 < \\alpha_1} \n\n\n\n",

      "Here's the solution:\n\nStep 1: **Understand the problem.** We are given a sinusoidal function,  f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4), and we need to find a value 'a' that makes the function periodic with a period of '3a'.\n\nStep 2: **Recall the period of the sine function.** The general sine function, y = sin(bx), has a period of 2\u03c0/|b|.\n\nStep 3: **Apply the period to our function.** In our case, b = 2. Therefore, the period of f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) is 2\u03c0/2 = \u03c0.\n\nStep 4: **Relate the period to the given condition.** We want f(x+a) = f(x+3a) to hold true. This means the function repeats itself after a shift of 'a' units, and also after a shift of '3a' units.  For this to be true, the period of the function must be a multiple of both 'a' and '3a'.\n\nStep 5: **Find the value of 'a'.** Since the period of the function is \u03c0, we need to find a value of 'a' within the interval (0, \u03c0) that satisfies the condition:\n\n\u03c0 = k * a  and \u03c0 = k' * 3a, where k and k' are integers.\n\nThe smallest common multiple of 'a' and '3a' is 3a.  Therefore,  a = \u03c0/3.\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}"

      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: **Define variables:** \n* Let  'x' be the number of miles the car traveled on gasoline.\n\nStep 2: **Calculate gasoline usage:** The car used 0.02 gallons per mile on gasoline, so for 'x' miles, it used 0.02x gallons.\n\nStep 3: **Calculate total distance:** The total distance of the trip is 40 miles (battery) + x miles (gasoline).\n\nStep 4: **Set up the average mileage equation:**  The average mileage is calculated as total distance divided by total gasoline used. We know the average mileage is 55 miles per gallon, so:\n\n(40 + x) / (0.02x) = 55\n\nStep 5: **Solve for x:** \n* Multiply both sides by 0.02x: 40 + x = 1.1x\n* Subtract x from both sides: 40 = 0.1x\n* Divide both sides by 0.1: x = 400 miles\n\nStep 6: **Calculate total trip distance:** Total distance = 40 miles (battery) + 400 miles (gasoline) = 440 miles.\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{440} \n",

      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nWe know Jia found the correct solution (x=1, y=-1) to the system of equations. Yi made a mistake copying the value of 'c' and got a different solution (x=2, y=-6).  We need to use this information to find the original values of  'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\n**Step 2: Substitute Jia's Solution**\n\nSince Jia's solution (x=1, y=-1) is correct, we can substitute these values into both equations of the system:\n\n*  Equation 1:  *ax + by = 2* \n   *  a(1) + b(-1) = 2 \n   *  a - b = 2 \n\n* Equation 2: *cx - 3y = -2*\n   * c(1) - 3(-1) = -2\n   * c + 3 = -2\n   * c = -5\n\n**Step 3: Solve for 'a' and 'b'**\n\nNow we know 'c' is -5.  We can substitute this back into Equation 2:\n\n* c(1) - 3y = -2\n* (-5)(1) - 3y = -2\n* -5 - 3y = -2\n* -3y = 3\n* y = -1\n\nWe already know y = -1 from Jia's solution.  Now we can use 'a - b = 2' and substitute y = -1 into either of the original equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'.  Let's use Equation 1:\n\n* a(1) + b(-1) = 2\n* a - b = 2\n\nThere are multiple ways to solve for 'a' and 'b' from here. You could use substitution or elimination.  \n\n\n**Answer:**\n*  c = -5 \n*  a and b can be found using the equation a - b = 2.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to work through the remaining steps to find the values of 'a' and 'b'!\n"

Using the formula d = s * t, we can rearrange it to t = d/s. So, the time for the outward trip is 28.8 miles / s.\n\nStep 4: **Calculate time for the return trip:**  We know the return speed (24 mph) and the total trip time (3 hours).  We can use the formula t = d/s to find the time for the return trip.  We need to figure out the distance for the return trip first.

Set these two expressions equal to each other: 1.2y = 0.48z\n\n**4. Solve for y:**\n\n* Divide both sides by 1.2 to isolate y: y = (0.48z) / 1.2 \n* Simplify: y = 0.4z\n\n**5. Calculate the percentage decrease of y compared to z:**\n\n*  The difference between z and y is z - 0.4z = 0.6z\n*  The percentage decrease is (difference / original value) * 100%\n*  Percentage decrease = (0.6z / z) * 100% = 60%\n\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{60\\%} \n",

      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Define variables.**\n\n* Let 'c' be the time Matt takes to do a problem with a calculator (2 minutes).\n* Let 'n' be the time Matt takes to do a problem without a calculator.\n\n**Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information.**\n\n*  \"It takes Matt 2 minutes per problem to do his math homework with a calculator...\":  This translates to 20c = total time with calculator.\n*  \"...and a certain amount of time per problem without a calculator.\": This translates to 20n = total time without a calculator.\n*  \"If Matt's assignment has 20 problems, using a calculator will save him 60 minutes.\": This translates to 20n - 20c = 60\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the equations.**\n\n* We can simplify the equation 20n - 20c = 60 by dividing both sides by 20: n - c = 3\n\n**Step 4: Solve for 'n'.**\n\n* Since we know c = 2, substitute it into the equation n - 2 = 3.\n* Add 2 to both sides to isolate 'n': n = 5.\n\n\n\n**Answer: \\boxed{5} minutes**\n",
