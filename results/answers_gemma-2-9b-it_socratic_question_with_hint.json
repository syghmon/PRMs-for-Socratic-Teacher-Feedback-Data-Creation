We'll need more information to find 'a' and 'd' directly. However, we can focus on finding the fifth house number (a+4d).\n\nStep 5: **Lack of sufficient information:**  Without more information about the pattern (e.g., the number of houses, or the relationship between the first and last house numbers), we cannot determine the specific value of the fifth house number. \n\n\n**Answer:** We need more information to find the house number of the fifth house. \n",

The maximum value of  (2/9) - (b - 1)\u00b2  occurs when (b - 1)\u00b2 = 0, which means b = 1.\n\n*  When b = 1, (a - 1/3)\u00b2 = 2/9, so a - 1/3 = \u00b1\u221a(2/9).\n\n* This gives us two possible values for 'a': a = 1/3 + \u221a(2/9) and a = 1/3 - \u221a(2/9).\n\n**Step 5: Find the maximum value of 3a + b**\n\n*  Substitute the values of 'a' and 'b' into the expression 3a + b and find the maximum value.\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to calculate the maximum value of 3a + b! \n",

This means the domain of $g(x)$ is the range of $f(x)$, which is all real numbers. The range of $g(x)$ is the domain of $f(x)$, which is $x > 0$.\n\nStep 7:  We are asked to find the range of $g(x)$ on the interval $[1, 2]$. Since the range of $g(x)$ is $x > 0$, and our interval is within that range, the range of $y = g(x)$ on $[1, 2]$ is simply **\\boxed{[1, 2]}.** \n\n\n",
      "Here's the solution:\n\nStep 1: Understand the behavior of the base-1/2 logarithm. The function  $f(x) = \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}}x$  gives us the power to which we need to raise 1/2 to get *x*.  Since 0 < 1/2 < 1, the logarithm will be positive when *x* is between 0 and 1, and negative when *x* is greater than 1. \n\nStep 2: Consider the inverse function. The inverse function,  $g(x)$, will \"reverse\" the process. If $f(a) = b$, then $g(b) = a$.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the range of *f(x)*.  The domain of $f(x)$ is  (0, \u221e) (all positive real numbers).  Since the function is decreasing, its range is all real numbers.\n\nStep 4: Determine the range of *g(x)*. Since the range of $f(x)$ is all real numbers, the domain of $g(x)$ is also all real numbers. \n\nStep 5: Focus on the interval [1, 2].  We are asked to find the range of $g(x)$ on the interval [1, 2].  Since the range of $f(x)$ is all real numbers, the inverse function $g(x)$ will map the interval [1, 2] to some interval on the real number line.\n\n**Answer:**  The range of $y = g(x)$ on the interval [1, 2] is **all real numbers**. \n\n\n"

      "Here's how we can solve for *a*, *b*, and *c*:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System**\n\nWe have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns (*x* and *y*).  Jia found the correct solution, and Yi found an incorrect solution due to a mistake in the value of *c*.\n\n**Step 2: Substitute Jia's Solution**\n\nJia found that *x* = 1 and *y* = -1.  Let's substitute these values into both original equations:\n\n* **Equation 1:**  *ax* + *by* = 2\n   * a(1) + b(-1) = 2\n   * a - b = 2 \n\n* **Equation 2:** *cx* - 3*y* = -2\n   * c(1) - 3(-1) = -2\n   * c + 3 = -2\n   * c = -5\n\n**Step 3:  Analyze Yi's Solution**\n\nYi found *x* = 2 and *y* = -6. Let's substitute these values into the original equations:\n\n* **Equation 1:** *ax* + *by* = 2\n   * a(2) + b(-6) = 2\n   * 2a - 6b = 2\n\n* **Equation 2:** *cx* - 3*y* = -2\n   * c(2) - 3(-6) = -2  \n\nWe already know that *c* = -5, so let's substitute that in:\n   * -5(2) - 3(-6) = -2\n   * -10 + 18 = -2\n   * 8 = -2 (This is not true!)\n\n**Step 4:  The Problem with Yi's Solution**\n\nThe fact that Yi's solution doesn't satisfy the second equation tells us that the value of *c* she used must be incorrect. This confirms that our earlier calculation of *c* = -5 is correct.\n\n**Step 5: Solve for 'a' and 'b'**\n\nWe have the equation *a - b = 2*  from Jia's solution.  We can solve for *a* in terms of *b*:\n\n* a = b + 2\n\nSince we have one equation and two unknowns, we can't find unique values for *a* and *b*.  There are infinitely many solutions for *a* and *b* that will work with the given system of equations.\n\n\n\n\n**Answer:** \n\n*  *c* = -5\n*  *a* = *b* + 2 (where *b* can be any real number) \n\n\n\n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: **Understand the Problem:** We know Jia found the correct solution (x=1, y=-1) using the system of equations. Yi made a mistake copying the value of 'c', leading to a different solution (x=2, y=-6).  Our goal is to find the original values of a, b, and c.\n\nStep 2: **Use Jia's Solution:** Since Jia found the correct solution, we can substitute x=1 and y=-1 into both equations to form two equations with three unknowns (a, b, and c).\n\n* Equation 1:  a(1) + b(-1) = 2  \n   This simplifies to: a - b = 2\n\n* Equation 2: c(1) - 3(-1) = -2\n   This simplifies to: c + 3 = -2\n\nStep 3: **Solve for c:**  From Equation 2, we can easily solve for c:\n   c + 3 = -2\n   c = -5\n\nStep 4: **Substitute c back into Equation 2:** Now that we know c = -5, we can substitute it back into the second original equation:\n\n   -5x - 3y = -2\n\nStep 5: **Use Yi's Solution:** Yi's solution (x=2, y=-6) must satisfy this equation. Let's substitute these values:\n\n   -5(2) - 3(-6) = -2\n   -10 + 18 = -2\n\n   8 = -2  (This is not true!)\n\nStep 6: **Analyze the Discrepancy:** The fact that 8 = -2 is not possible means there's a fundamental issue.  Yi's incorrect solution indicates that the system of equations is inconsistent (has no solution) or that there's an error in the problem statement.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**  Based on the given information, we cannot definitively find the values of a and b.  The system of equations is likely inconsistent or contains an error. \n",

Squaring both sides, we get |*z<sub>1</sub>* + *z<sub>2</sub>*|\u00b2 = 3.\n\nStep 13: Expanding |*z<sub>1</sub>* + *z<sub>2</sub>*|\u00b2  using the same logic as in Step 9, we get:\n|*z<sub>1</sub>* + *z<sub>2</sub>*|\u00b2 = |*z<sub>1</sub>*|\u00b2 + 2 * Re(*z<sub>1</sub>* * *z<sub>2</sub>*) + |*z<sub>2</sub>*|\u00b2\n\nStep 14: Substituting the known values, 3 = 1 + 2 * Re(*z<sub>1</sub>* * *z<sub>2</sub>*) + 1.\n\nStep 15: Simplifying, 3 = 2 + 2 * Re(*z<sub>1</sub>* * *z<sub>2</sub>*).\n\nStep 16:  Therefore, Re(*z<sub>1</sub>* * *z<sub>2</sub>*) = 1/2.\n\nStep 17: Substituting this value back into Step 11, we get:\n|*z<sub>1</sub>* - *z<sub>2</sub>*|\u00b2 = 2 - 2 * (1/2) = 1.\n\nStep 18: Taking the square root of both sides, we find:\n|*z<sub>1</sub>* - *z<sub>2</sub>*| = \u221a1 = 1.\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{1}",

      "Here's how to find the 100th term:\n\nStep 1: **Analyze the pattern:**  The sequence consists of powers of 3 and sums of distinct powers of 3.  \n\nStep 2: **Identify the repeating pattern:** Notice that the sequence alternates between:\n   *  A power of 3: 1, 3, 9, 27...\n   *  A sum of two consecutive powers of 3: 4 (1+3), 10 (3+7), 12 (3+9), 13 (3+10)...\n\nStep 3: **Determine the relevant power:**  To find the 100th term, we need to figure out if it falls within the powers of 3 or the sums of powers of 3. Since the sequence alternates, we can check if 100 is even or odd. \n\nStep 4: **Even or odd?**: 100 is even.  This means the 100th term will be a sum of two consecutive powers of 3.\n\nStep 5: **Find the powers:** We need to find the powers of 3 that will add up to the 100th term.  Keep in mind that the sequence starts with 1, 3, 9, 27...\n\nStep 6: **Calculate:**  You'll need to calculate powers of 3 until you find two consecutive powers that add up to a number close to 100.  This will involve some trial and error.\n\nStep 7: **Final answer:** Once you find the two powers, add them together to get the 100th term.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to work through the specific calculation of the powers of 3. \n",

Since the sequence alternates between powers of 3 and powers of 3 + 1, we need to figure out if the 100th term falls within the powers of 3 or the powers of 3 + 1.\n\nStep 4:  Find the highest power of 3 less than 100.  3\u2074 = 81, and 3\u2075 = 243, so the highest power of 3 less than 100 is 3\u2074.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the number of terms up to 3\u2074. There are 5 terms (3\u2070, 3\u00b9, 3\u00b2, 3\u00b3, 3\u2074)\n\nStep 6: Determine the remaining terms. Since 100 is greater than 5, we need to consider the terms after 3\u2074.  \n\nStep 7:  Find the position of the 100th term within the powers of 3 + 1.  100 - 5 = 95.  Since 95 is odd, the 100th term is part of the sequence 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, ...\n\nStep 8: Determine the 95th term in the powers of 3 + 1 sequence.
