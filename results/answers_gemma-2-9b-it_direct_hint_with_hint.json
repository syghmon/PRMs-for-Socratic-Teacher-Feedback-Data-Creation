For example, [3.2] = 3, [5] = 5, and [-1.7] = -2.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the equation's behavior**\n\n* **For integers x:**  The term [x] will simply be x itself. The equation becomes 2^x - 2x - 1 = 0.  Solving this equation for integer values of x is not straightforward and likely requires numerical methods or trial-and-error.\n\n* **For non-integer x:** The term [x] will be an integer less than x.  Consider the behavior of 2^x as x increases.  2^x grows exponentially.  As x increases, the difference between 2^x and 2[x] will also increase.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the relationship between the terms**\n\nThe equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0  implies that the exponential term (2^x) needs to be very close to the linear term (2[x] + 1) for the equation to hold.  \n\n* **When x is between two consecutive integers:** The term [x] will be fixed, and the difference between 2^x and 2[x] will be significant due to the exponential growth of 2^x.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the number of solutions**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the equation is likely to have only a limited number of integer solutions.

      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the leak rate:** The tank empties completely in 3 hours, so the leak rate is 1 tank / 3 hours.\n\n2. **Calculate the combined fill rate:** Pipe A fills at 6 liters/minute, and Pipe B fills at 4 liters/minute, giving a combined fill rate of 10 liters/minute.\n\n3. **Convert fill rate to hourly rate:**  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the combined fill rate is 10 liters/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 600 liters/hour.\n\n4. **Calculate the rate at which the tank is emptied:** Since the tank empties in 12 hours, the overall emptying rate is 1 tank / 12 hours.\n\n5. **Set up an equation:** Let 'x' represent the capacity of the tank in liters. The equation representing the situation is: \n   (600 liters/hour) - (leak rate) = (1 tank / 12 hours)\n\n6. **Substitute the leak rate:** We know the leak rate is 1 tank / 3 hours, so the equation becomes:\n   (600 liters/hour) - (1 tank / 3 hours) = (1 tank / 12 hours)\n\n7. **Solve for x (tank capacity):**\n   *  To get rid of the mixed units, multiply the leak rate term by 12/12: (600 liters/hour) - (4 tanks / 12 hours) = (1 tank / 12 hours)\n   *  Combine the leak rate terms: (600 liters/hour) - (4 tanks / 12 hours) = (1 tank / 12 hours)\n   *  Since the leak rate is in terms of tanks, we need to express the fill rate in terms of tanks as well.  Divide 600 liters/hour by the number of liters per tank to get the fill rate in terms of tanks per hour.  (We'll need the value of 'x' to do this).\n\n\nAnswer:  The problem can't be solved without knowing the number of liters per tank.  \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1.  Determine the leak rate:**\n\n* The tank empties completely in 3 hours, meaning the leak drains it at a rate of 1 tank / 3 hours.\n\n**2. Calculate the combined filling rate:**\n\n* Pipe A fills at 6 liters/minute, which is 6 * 60 = 360 liters/hour.\n* Pipe B fills at 4 liters/minute, which is 4 * 60 = 240 liters/hour.\n* The combined filling rate is 360 + 240 = 600 liters/hour.\n\n**3.  Set up the equation:**\n\n* Let 'x' represent the capacity of the tank in liters.\n* The rate at which the tank is being emptied is 1 tank / 12 hours = x / 12 liters/hour.\n* The net rate of change is the combined filling rate minus the leak rate: (600 - x/12) liters/hour.\n\n**4.

The leak rate is 1 tank / 3 hours, which we need to express in liters per hour.  Let's assume the tank holds 'x' liters. The leak rate is then x liters / 3 hours = x/3 liters/hour. The net fill rate is 600 liters/hour - x/3 liters/hour.\n\nStep 5: **Set up an equation:** The tank is being filled at a net rate of (600 - x/3) liters per hour and is emptied completely in 12 hours.

Inlet Pipe B fills at 4 liters/minute, which is 4 * 60 = 240 liters per hour.

The height of triangle MCD from point M to side CD will vary depending on M's location.\n\nStep 3: **Area Ratio:**  We want to find the probability that the area of triangle MCD is less than S/3.

      "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship:**  The area of a triangle is half the area of the parallelogram it's formed from if they share the same height.\n\n2. **Consider the Height:**  Draw a height from point $D$ to side $AB$ (or $BC$, it doesn't matter). This height is the same for both the parallelogram and triangle $MCD$.\n\n3. **Area Ratios:** Let the height be represented by $h$. The area of the parallelogram is $S = AB \\cdot h$.  The area of triangle $MCD$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot CD \\cdot h$.\n\n4. **Probability Condition:** We want the probability that the triangle's area is less than $\\frac{S}{3}$.  This means:\n   \n   $$\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot CD \\cdot h < \\frac{S}{3}$$\n\n5. **Substitute and Simplify:** Substitute $S = AB \\cdot h$:\n\n   $$\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot CD \\cdot h < \\frac{AB \\cdot h}{3}$$\n\n   Simplify by dividing both sides by $\\frac{1}{2}h$:\n\n   $$CD < \\frac{2}{3} AB$$\n\n6. **Geometric Interpretation:** This inequality means that point $M$ must lie within a region of the parallelogram where the distance from $M$ to line $AB$ is less than $\\frac{2}{3}$ the length of $AB$.\n\n7. **Area of Favorable Region:** This favorable region is a smaller parallelogram within $ABCD$, with a height of $\\frac{2}{3}h$ and a base of $AB$.

      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: **Calculate the amount invested in each bond.**  Since Shawn invested half his savings in each bond, he invested $2750 / 2 = $1375 in each bond.\n\nStep 2: **Calculate the simple interest rate.**  He earned $550 in simple interest over 2 years from the first bond.  The simple interest formula is I = Prt, where I is interest, P is principal, r is the rate, and t is time.  We can rearrange this to solve for r: r = I / (Pt).  Plugging in our values, r = $550 / ($1375 * 2) = 0.20 or 20%.\n\nStep 3: **Calculate the amount earned from the compound interest bond.**  We know the simple interest rate is 20%.  Let 'x' be the amount of interest earned from the compound interest bond. The total value of the compound interest bond after 2 years is $1375 + x.  \n\nStep 4: **Set up the compound interest equation.** The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. In this case, n = 1 (compounded annually).  We know A = $1375 + x, P = $1375, r = 0.20, and t = 2.  Substituting these values: \n$1375 + x = $1375(1 + 0.20/1)^(1*2)\n\nStep 5: **Solve for x.**\n* $1375 + x = $1375(1.20)^2$\n* $1375 + x = $1375 * 1.44$\n* $1375 + x = $1986$\n* $x = $1986 - $1375$\n* $x = $611$\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{$611} \n",
