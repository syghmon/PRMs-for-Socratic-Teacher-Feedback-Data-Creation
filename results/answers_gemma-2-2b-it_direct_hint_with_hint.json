This equation involves an exponential term (2^x) and a term involving the greatest integer function. \n\n**Solution Strategy**\n\n1. **Analyze the Equation:**  The equation involves both an exponential function (2^x) and a term with the greatest integer function ([x]).  Understanding how these interact is key.\n\n2. **Consider Different Intervals:** The greatest integer function ([x]) creates a piecewise nature to the function. We need to consider different intervals of x to find the solutions.\n\n3. **Examine the Relationship:** We need to analyze how the equation behaves within each interval to determine the number of solutions.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n1. **Understanding the Greatest Integer Function:** The greatest integer function, denoted by [x], gives the greatest integer less than or equal to x.

Set up an equation to represent the emptying time:**\n\n* The tank empties in 12 hours, which is 12 * 60 = 720 minutes. \n*  We can use this information to set up an equation: `720 = (x + 10) * 720`\n\n**4. Solve for x:**\n\n*  Divide both sides of the equation by (x + 10): `720 / (x + 10) = 720`\n\n**5. Simplify and solve for x:**\n*  Simplify to get `720 = 720(x + 10)`\n*  Divide both sides by 720: `1 = x + 10`\n*  Subtract 10 from both sides: `x = -9`\n\n**6.

Applying AM-GM**\n\nWe can rewrite the expression as:\n\n (16/x) + (108/y) + xy  =  (16/x) + (108/y) + xy\n\n**5.  Applying the AM-GM Inequality**\n\nNow, we need to find a way to apply the AM-GM inequality to this expression.  To do this, we'll consider the following:\n\n* **The goal is to minimize the expression.**\n* **The AM-GM inequality is best used when we have terms that can be arranged in a way that allows us to maximize the inequality.**\n\n**6.  Solving for the Minimum**\n\nWe can use the AM-GM inequality to find the minimum value of the expression. \n\n **Solution:**\n\n* **Finding the Minimum:**\n    * To minimize the expression, we need to find values for *x* and *y* that will make the terms in the expression as small as possible. \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of the steps! \n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem using the AM-GM inequality:\n\n**1.  Understanding the AM-GM Inequality**\n\nThe AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean) inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers *a* and *b*, the arithmetic mean (average) of *a* and *b* is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of *a* and *b*:\n\n  *  (a + b) / 2 \u2265 \u221a(a * b)\n\n**2.  Applying AM-GM to the Expression**\n\nLet's apply this to our expression:\n\n   *  We can rewrite the expression as:  \n     \n     \\(\\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy = 16x^{-1} + 108y^{-1} + xy\\)\n\n   *  Now, notice that we can group the terms to get: \n\n     \\(16x^{-1} + 108y^{-1} + xy = (16 + xy)x^{-1} + (108 + y)y^{-1}\\)\n\n**3.  Finding the Minimum**\n\n  *  We need to find the minimum value of:\n      \n      \\( (16 + xy)x^{-1} + (108 + y)y^{-1}\\)\n\n  *  We can apply AM-GM to each term:\n      \n      *  (16 + xy)x^{-1} + (108 + y)y^{-1}  \u2265  \u221a[(16 + xy)x^{-1} * (108 + y)y^{-1}] \n      \n      *  We know that the product of the geometric means of two numbers is always greater than or equal to the product of their arithmetic means, so we can write:\n\n        *  \u221a[(16 + xy)x^{-1} * (108 + y)y^{-1}] \u2265 \u221a[(16x^{-1} + 108y^{-1}) * (xy + 108y^{-1} + x^{-1})]\n\n**4.  Simplifying and Finding the Minimum**\n\n  *  We can simplify the expression further: \n\n      *  \u221a[(16x^{-1} + 108y^{-1}) * (xy + 108y^{-1} + x^{-1})] \u2265  \u221a[(16 + xy)x^{-1} * (108 + y)y^{-1}] \n\n      *  Since the expression is in the form of a product, we can apply AM-GM again to each term.\n\n  *  However,  we can see that the AM-GM inequality is not enough to solve the problem.  We need to consider the specific values of *x* and *y*.\n\n\n\n**5.  Conclusion**\n\nWhile the AM-GM inequality provides a useful tool for finding the minimum value, we need additional information about the values of *x* and *y* to get a concrete numerical answer. \n",

      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understanding the Inverse**\n\n* **Definition:**  A function has an inverse if and only if it passes the horizontal line test.  This means for every horizontal line drawn through the graph, there's exactly one point on the graph that the line intersects.  \n* **Finding the Inverse:** To find the inverse function, we swap the roles of x and y and solve for y. This process is usually a bit involved, but it's a fundamental concept.\n\n**2.  The Logarithm's Behavior**\n\n* **Base 1/2:** The base of the logarithm, 1/2, significantly affects the function.  Here's why:\n    * **Understanding Logarithms:**  The logarithm asks \"To what power must we raise the base to get the given value?\"\n    * **The Impact of 1/2:**  The base 1/2 means we need to find the power to which we raise 1/2 to get a particular value 'x'.  This is the inverse operation of exponentiation.\n\n**3. The Range of g(x)**\n\n* **Range:** The range of a function is the set of all possible output values. \n* **Analyzing the Inverse:**  The inverse function, g(x), will essentially \"undo\" the original function, f(x).  Because the inverse of a function is a reflection of the original function across the line y = x, we can deduce that the range of g(x) will be the same as the domain of f(x).\n\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe function $f(x) = \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}}x$ is defined for positive values of x.  Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$. \n \nLet's analyze this further:\n\n* The logarithmic function is defined only for positive values of its argument. \n* The logarithm of 0 is undefined. \n* The logarithm of a negative number is also undefined.  \n* The logarithm of a number less than 0 is undefined.  \n* Therefore, the range of $f(x) = \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}}x$ is $(0, \\infty)$.\n\n\n\n",
      "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Inverse Function**\n\n* The inverse of a function \"undoes\" the original function.  \n*  If  *f(x)* has an inverse function *g(x)*, then for every *y* in the range of *f(x)*, there exists a *x* in the domain of *f(x)* such that *f(x) = y* and *g(y) = x*.\n\n**2. Finding the Inverse**\n\n* To find the inverse of *f(x) = log\u2081\u2082x*, let's solve the equation for *x* in terms of *y*: \n   *  *y = log\u2081\u2082x*\n   *  *10\u02b8 = x*  (using the definition of logarithms)\n\n**3. Domain and Range of the Inverse**\n\n* The domain of the inverse function *g(x)* is the range of the original function *f(x)*. \n* The range of the inverse function *g(x)* is the domain of the original function *f(x)*.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Base**\n\n* The base of the logarithm, *1/2*, is the reciprocal of 2. \n* This means that the function *f(x) = log\u2081\u2082x*  is defined for values of *x* that are strictly greater than 0 and less than 1. \n* In other words, the function *f(x)* is defined for values of *x* in the interval (0, 1).\n\n\n**5. Determining the Range of g(x)**\n\n* Since the inverse function *g(x)* undoes the original function *f(x)*, we can find the range of *g(x)* by considering the range of *f(x)*. \n* The range of *f(x)* is all real numbers between *0* and *\u221e*. \n* The inverse function *g(x)* will map all real numbers between *0* and *\u221e* back to the same range. \n\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe range of the function *y = g(x)* on the interval [1, 2] is **[1, 2]**. \n",

This means we're looking for a value of 'a' that preserves the shape of the sine wave.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Function**\n\n* **Period:** The period of the sine function is 2\u03c0.  \n* **Phase Shift:** The function has a phase shift of \u03c0/4. \n* **Argument:** The argument of the sine function is (2x - \u03c0/4).\n\n**Step 2:  Finding the Relationship between f(x + a) and f(x + 3a)**\n\nLet's look at how the function's output changes with the phase shift and the argument:\n\n1. **f(x + a):** This represents the function shifted by 'a' units to the right.\n2. **f(x + 3a):** This represents the function shifted by 3a units to the right.\n\nWe need to find a value of 'a' that makes the function output the same for both f(x + a) and f(x + 3a).\n\n**Step 3: Utilizing the Sine Function's Period**\n\nThe period of the sine function is 2\u03c0. This means that after every 2\u03c0, the sine function repeats its pattern. We need to find a value of 'a' that allows us to cover the entire period.\n\n**Step 4: Setting up the Equation**\n\nWe know that the sine function repeats every 2\u03c0.  Let's use this to figure out the relationship between the arguments.\n\n* **f(x + a) = sin(2(x + a) - \u03c0/4)** \n* **f(x + 3a) = sin(2(x + 3a) - \u03c0/4)**\n\n**Step 5: Simplifying and Solving for 'a'**\n\nNow we need to simplify these equations and equate them. \n\n* **f(x + a) = sin(2x + 2a - \u03c0/4)**\n* **f(x + 3a) = sin(2x + 6a - \u03c0/4)**\n\nSince we want f(x + a) to equal f(x + 3a), we need to find a value of 'a' that makes the arguments of the sine function the same.\n\n**Step 6: Finding the Solution**\n\nThe key is to understand that the sine function repeats its pattern every 2\u03c0.  Therefore, we need to find the value of 'a' that makes the arguments of the sine function the same after every 2\u03c0. \n\n\nThis will allow you to solve for the value of 'a' in radians. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to work through the specific calculations for 'a'! \n",

Focus and Major Axis**\n\n* The foci of an ellipse lie on the major axis, at a distance of 'c' units from the center. \n*  We know the distance from point P to one focus is 3, so the distance from point P to the center of the ellipse is also 3. \n\n**3. Finding 'c'**\n\n* We can use the formula:  $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, where:\n    * 'a' is the semi-major axis (half the length of the major axis).\n    * 'b' is the semi-minor axis (half the length of the minor axis).\n*  From the given equation, we can find 'a' and 'b':\n    * $\\frac{x^{2}}{25} = 1$  =>  $a^2 = 25$  =>  $a = 5$\n    * $\\frac{y^{2}}{16} = 1$  =>  $b^2 = 16$  =>  $b = 4$\n\n* Now, substitute 'a' and 'b' into the formula:\n   * $c^2 = 25 - 16 = 9$\n   * $c = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\n**4.

Express y in terms of x:**\n\n* Substitute the first equation into the second equation:\n    *  y = x + 0.15(y)\n    *  y - 0.15y = x\n    *  0.85y = x\n\n* Solve for y:\n    *  y = x / 0.85\n\n**4.  Use the cost price information:**\n\n* The cost price is given as $1250.  We can now substitute this into the equation for y:\n    *  1250 = x / 0.85\n\n**5. Solve for x (the loss percentage):**\n\n* Multiply both sides by 0.85:\n    *  1250 * 0.85 = x\n    *  1062.5 = x\n\n**Answer:  The loss percentage when the article was initially sold was 1062.5%.** \n \n**Important Notes:**\n* Percentages are always expressed as a fraction of 100.  \n* This is a tricky problem because the loss percentage and the selling price are related by a non-linear equation. \n* The solution to this problem is not a typical percentage. This is a result of the way the problem was worded. \n\n\n\n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define Variables:**\n\n* Let 'x' be the loss percentage. \n* The selling price would be the cost price minus the loss, so the selling price is (100-x)% of the cost price.\n\n**2.

Solve for the Cost Price:**\n\n* Let's use the information about the selling price:  $1750 = (100 - x) * $1250.\n* Simplify the equation: $1750 = $125000 - 1250x\n* Combine like terms: $1250x = $123250\n* Divide both sides by $1250: x = 9.8.\n\n**Answer: ** \\boxed{9.8}% \n",

Determine the Number to Add**\n\n* Let the number we need to add be 'x'.\n* The expression (number + x) will be divisible by 8, 11, and 24.\n* This means (number + x) is also a multiple of 8, 11, and 24. \n\n**4. Simplify the Equation**\n\n* Since the LCM is a multiple of all three numbers, we can express this as a multiple of the LCM. \n\n* (number + x) = LCM(8, 11, 24)\n\n\n**5. Solve for x**\n\n*  We know that the LCM of 8, 11, and 24 is 8 * 11 * 24. \n*   Therefore, the number we need to add is the same as the LCM of 8, 11, and 24.\n\n\n**6.
