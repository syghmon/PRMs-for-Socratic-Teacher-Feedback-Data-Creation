Completing the Square**\n\nTo understand the behavior of this quadratic, let's rewrite it in a form that makes it easier to analyze.  We can do this by completing the square:\n\n*  **Factor out a -1:** \n   The expression becomes: $-(x^2 - 2x + 2 + m)$\n\n* **Complete the square inside the parentheses:**  Half of -2 is -1, and squaring that gives us 1.

Analyzing the Expression**\n\nNow we have: $-[(x - 1)^2 + 2 + m]$\n\n* **Multiply by -1:**  This flips the inequality sign:  $(x - 1)^2 + 2 + m > 0$\n\n**4.  Finding the Range of *m***\n\n* **Set the expression equal to zero:**\n   $(x - 1)^2 + 2 + m = 0$\n\n* **Solve for *m*:**\n    *  $(x - 1)^2 = -2 - m$\n    *  $x - 1 = \\pm \\sqrt{-2 - m}$ \n\n* **Considering the Range:** \n    *  For the quadratic to be positive (greater than zero), the expression $(x - 1)^2$ must be greater than zero. This means $-2 - m > 0$.\n    *  Solving for *m*, we get: $m < -2$.\n\n**5.

Combining the Inequalities**\n\nNow, let's combine the inequalities from each term:\n\n\\( \\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy \\ge 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{x}} + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{108}{y}} + 2\\sqrt{xy} \\)\n\n**5. Finding the Minimum**\n\nWe want to find the smallest possible value of this expression. To do this, we need to minimize the terms on the right side.  Notice that the terms \\(2\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{x}}\\) and \\(2\\sqrt{\\frac{108}{y}}\\) are minimized when \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are as small as possible.\n\n**6. Simplifying**\n\nWe need to find the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that minimize the terms on the right side of the inequality.  This will involve a bit of trial and error and some knowledge of the AM-GM inequality.\n\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe problem is designed to be a bit of a trick question, and there's no single, easy answer.  The AM-GM inequality helps us understand the relationships between the terms, but finding the smallest possible value for the entire expression requires more complex analysis.  \n",

Using Trigonometric Identities**\n\n* **Recall:**  sin(x) = sin(\u03c0 - x)\n* **Apply:**  We can use this identity to simplify our expression.\n\n**3. Setting up the Equation**\n\nLet's start by substituting (x + a) for 'x' in the original function:\n\nf(x + a) = sin(2(x + a) - \u03c0/4)\n\nNow, let's substitute (x + 3a) for 'x' in the equation:\n\nf(x + 3a) = sin(2(x + 3a) - \u03c0/4)\n\n**4. Simplifying and Comparing**\n\nWe want these two expressions to be equal.  Let's simplify both sides:\n\n* f(x + a) = sin(2x + 2a - \u03c0/4)\n* f(x + 3a) = sin(2x + 6a - \u03c0/4)\n\n**5. Using the Key Insight**\n\nNotice that the sine function has the same value for both expressions if and only if:\n\n2x + 2a - \u03c0/4 = 2x + 6a - \u03c0/4\n\n**6. Solving for 'a'**\n\n* Simplify the equation: 2a - \u03c0/4 = 6a - \u03c0/4\n* Combine like terms: -4a = 0\n* Solve for 'a': a = 0\n\n**7. Expressing the Answer**\n\nTherefore, the value of 'a' that satisfies the given condition is **a = 0 radians**. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other math problems you'd like to work through! \n"

Calculate Shawn's initial investment:**\n\n*   Shawn's total savings before investing were $2750.\n*   Let 'x' be the initial investment amount. \n*   Shawn invested half his savings: x/2\n*   Therefore, x/2 was invested in the simple interest bond.\n\n**2. Calculate the simple interest earned:**\n\n*   The interest from the simple interest bond was $550.\n*   Simple interest formula: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time\n*   We know Interest = $550, Time = 2 years.\n*   We need to find the Principal (x/2) and the Rate. \n\n**3.  Find the Rate of Simple Interest:**\n\n*   Let's denote the rate of simple interest as 'r'.\n*   Simple Interest = (x/2) * r * 2\n*   Simplifying: Simple Interest = (x * r) \n*   We know the simple interest is $550. \n*   Therefore:  $550 = (x * r)\n\n**4. Calculate the remaining investment amount:**\n\n*   Shawn invested the remaining amount in the compound interest bond.\n*   The remaining investment amount was: 2750 - (x/2) \n\n**5. Calculate the compound interest earned:**\n\n*   Let's denote the interest earned from the compound interest bond as 'y'.\n*   Compound interest formula: y = Principal * (1 + Rate/n)^nt - Principal\n*   We know Principal = (2750 - (x/2))\n*   We know n = 1 (compounded annually)\n*   We know t = 2 years\n*   We need to find y.\n\n\n**6.  Set up an equation to solve for the rate of interest:**\n\n*   We know the total interest from both bonds is $550. \n*   Let's call the interest from the compound interest bond 'y'. \n*   We know the simple interest is $550. \n*   Therefore: y + $550 = total interest\n\n**7.  Solve for x:**\n\n*   We have an equation to solve for x. \n*   Substitute the value of y and solve for x. \n\n \n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   You'll need to use the information from the problem and the formulas for simple and compound interest to solve for the rate and the total interest. \n\n\n\n",

Solve for the percentage decrease of y compared to z:**\n\n*  We can solve for y in terms of z: y = 0.48z / 1.20\n*  Simplify: y = 0.4 * z\n*  To find the percentage decrease of y compared to z, we can use the following formula:  \n   Percentage Decrease = ( (Original Value - Final Value) / Original Value ) * 100%\n\n*  Since y = 0.4 * z, the percentage decrease is:  \n    ( (0.4 * z - z) / z ) * 100% =  ( -0.6 * z / z) * 100% = -60%\n\n\n\n**Answer:**  The percentage decrease of y compared to z is \\boxed{-60%}. \n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Define the variables:**\n\n* Let z represent the original value of the quantity.\n* Let y represent the value of y (less than z).\n* Let x represent the value of x (more than y).\n\n**2. Set up the equations:**\n\n* We know x is 20% more than y:  x = 1.20y \n* We know y is some percent less than z: y = 0.9z\n* We know x is 48% of z: x = 0.48z\n\n**3. Substitute and solve for y:**\n\n* Substitute the value of x and y from the given equations:  0.48z = 1.20y \n* Substitute the value of y from the second equation: 0.48z = 1.20 * (0.9z)\n* Simplify the equation: 0.48z = 1.08z\n* Subtract 0.48z from both sides: 0 = 0.60z\n* Solve for z: z = 0.60 / 0.60 = 1\n\n\n**4. Calculate the percentage decrease of y:**\n\n* Since y = 0.9z, we can find the percentage decrease by calculating the difference between y and z, then dividing by z and multiplying by 100%:\n \n * Percentage decrease = [(y - z) / z] * 100% \n * Percentage decrease = [(0.9z - z) / z] * 100%\n * Percentage decrease = [(0.9 - 1) / 1] * 100% \n * Percentage decrease = (-0.1 / 1) * 100%\n * Percentage decrease = -10%\n\n\n\n**Answer:** The percentage decrease of y compared to z is **-10%**. \n"

Recall that: \n  sin(a - b) = sin a cos b - cos a sin b\n\n**Step 3:** Apply the property to our problem. Let a = \u03c0/2 and b = \u03c0/6. So:\n  sin(\u03c0/2 - \u03c0/6) = sin(\u03c0/2)cos(\u03c0/6) - cos(\u03c0/2)sin(\u03c0/6)\n\n**Step 4:**  Recall the values of sin(\u03c0/2) and cos(\u03c0/2).\n  * sin(\u03c0/2) = 1\n  * cos(\u03c0/2) = 0\n\n**Step 5:** Substitute the values into the equation:\n  sin(\u03c0/2 - \u03c0/6) = (1)(cos(\u03c0/6)) - (0)(sin(\u03c0/6))\n\n**Step 6:**  Remember that cos(\u03c0/6) = \u221a3/2.\n  sin(\u03c0/2 - \u03c0/6) = (1)(\u221a3/2) = \u221a3/2\n\n**Answer:**  \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} \n"
