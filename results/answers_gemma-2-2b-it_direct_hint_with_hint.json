      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Define variables:**\n   * Let 'r' represent the time it takes Ryan to dig the hole alone.\n   * Let 'c' represent the rate at which Castel digs the hole.\n\n2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**\n   * We know Castel digs the hole in 6 hours, so his rate is c = 1/6 of the hole per hour.\n   *  Ryan digs the hole alone, so his rate is r = 1/r of the hole per hour.\n   * Together, they dig at a combined rate of (1/r) + (1/c)  of the hole per hour. \n\n3. **Use the given information about working together:**\n   * The combined rate (1/r) + (1/c) = 2.72727272727  \n   * We can rewrite this equation as: 1/r + 1/(6) = 2.72727272727\n\n4. **Solve for 'r':**\n   * Isolate the term with 'r' by subtracting 1/(6) from both sides of the equation: 1/r = 2.72727272727 - 1/(6)\n   *  Multiply both sides by r to get rid of the denominator: 1 = 2.72727272727r - (1/6)r\n   *  Combine terms: 1 = (15.72727272727 - 1/6)r\n   *  Simplify: 1 = (90.21272727273)r\n   *  Divide both sides by (90.21272727273) to isolate 'r': r = 1 / (90.21272727273)\n\n5. **Calculate the time it takes Ryan to dig alone:**\n   * r = 1 / (90.21272727273)\n   *  Ryan takes approximately 0.011 hours or 0.66 minutes to dig the hole alone.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{0.66 \\text{ minutes}} \n",

Use the Pythagorean identity:**\n\n  sin^2 \u03b1 + cos^2 \u03b1 = 1\n\n  We know sin \u03b1 = \u221a15 / 4, so we can solve for cos \u03b1:\n  cos \u03b1 = \u221a(1 - sin^2 \u03b1) = \u221a(1 - (\u221a15 / 4)^2) = \u221a(1 - 15/16) = \u221a(1/16) = 1/4\n\n**6.

Simplify the expression:**\n\n  sin(\u03b1 + \u03c0/4) = (\u221a30 / 8) + (\u221a2 / 8)\n\n**8. Use the double-angle formula for sine:**\n\n  sin 2\u03b1 = 2 sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1\n\n  Substitute the known values:\n  sin 2\u03b1 = 2 * (\u221a15 / 4) * (1/4) = (\u221a15 / 8)\n\n**9. Use the double-angle formula for cosine:**\n\n  cos 2\u03b1 = 1 - 2 sin^2 \u03b1\n\n  Substitute the known value:\n  cos 2\u03b1 = 1 - 2 * (\u221a15 / 4)^2 = 1 - (15/8) = 3/8\n\n**10. Substitute the values of sin 2\u03b1 and cos 2\u03b1 into the expression:**\n\n  (sin(\u03b1 + \u03c0/4) / (sin 2\u03b1 + cos 2\u03b1 + 1)) = [(\u221a30 / 8) + (\u221a2 / 8)] / [(\u221a15 / 8) + (3/8) + 1]\n\n**11.

Calculate the Probability of Scores Between 80 and 90:**\n\n* To find the probability of scores between 80 and 90, subtract the probability of a z-score being less than 0.1 from 1.\n*  The probability of a z-score being less than 0.1 is 0.5398. \n*  The probability of a z-score being less than 0.1 is 0.5398. \n*  The probability of a z-score being between 0 and 0.1 is 1 - 0.5398 = 0.4602.\n\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{0.4602} \n\n\n\n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the problem:** We need to find the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points.  \n\n**2. Use the z-score:**  Since the scores follow a normal distribution, we can use the z-score to standardize the values. The z-score tells us how many standard deviations a particular value is from the mean.\n\n**3. Calculate the z-scores:** \n   * For 80 points:  z = (80 - 80) / 100 = 0\n   * For 90 points: z = (90 - 80) / 100 = 1\n\n**4. Use the z-table:**  A z-table gives us the probability of getting a z-score less than or equal to a certain value.  \n\n* Look up the probability associated with a z-score of 0 (the z-score for 80 points) in the z-table. You'll find a probability of 0.5.\n* Look up the probability associated with a z-score of 1 in the z-table. You'll find a probability of 0.8413.\n\n**5. Find the difference in probabilities:**  The difference between the two probabilities is the probability of getting a z-score between 0 and 1. \n   * P(0 \u2264 z \u2264 1) = 0.8413 - 0.5 = 0.3413\n\n**6. Apply the z-score to the normal distribution:** Since the normal distribution is symmetrical, the area under the curve between the z-scores is equal to the probability we calculated.\n\n**7.  Calculate the number of students:**  We need to find the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points. \n\n**Final Answer: ** \\boxed{16} \n\nLet me know if you'd like me to explain any of these steps in more detail! \n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\nWe are given that the distribution of test scores follows a normal distribution with a mean (\u03bc) of 80 and a standard deviation (\u03c3) of 100. We need to find the proportion of students who scored between 80 and 90 points.\n\n**2.  Use the Z-score:**\n\n* A standard normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.  \n* To find the proportion of students scoring between 80 and 90 points, we need to convert these scores to Z-scores.  \n\n**3. Calculate the Z-scores:**\n\n* For a score of 80, the Z-score is calculated as:  Z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3 = (80 - 80) / 100 = 0\n* For a score of 90, the Z-score is: Z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3 = (90 - 80) / 100 = 0.1\n\n**4. Find the Area Under the Curve:**\n\n* We want the area under the normal curve between the Z-scores of 0 and 0.1. \n* You can use a Z-table or a statistical calculator to find this area.  The Z-table provides the area to the left of a specific Z-score. Since we want the area between two Z-scores, we need to subtract the area to the left of 0 from the area to the left of 0.1. \n\n**5. Calculate the Probability:**\n\n* Using a Z-table or a calculator, the area to the left of Z = 0 is 0.5. \n* The area to the left of Z = 0.1 is 0.5 + (0.1 - 0.5) = 0.1.\n* The probability of a student scoring between 80 and 90 points is the difference between the two areas: 0.5 - 0.1 = 0.4.\n\n\n**Answer:**  \\boxed{4} \n \n \n**Important Note:**  The question asks for the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points, not the probability.  \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other math problems you'd like help with! \n",

Use the Standard Normal Table or Calculator:**\n\n*  Look up the probabilities for Z-scores 0 and 0.1 in a standard normal table or use a calculator. You'll find:\n    * P(Z < 0) = 0.5\n    * P(Z < 0.1) = 0.5398\n\n**4.

Interpret the Result:**\n\n*  The probability of scoring between 80 and 90 points is approximately 0.0398, which means approximately **3.98%** of students scored within that range. \n\n\n"

      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the problem:**\n\n* The tradesman made a loss on the article, meaning the selling price was less than the cost price.\n* If the selling price had been increased by $500, there would have been a 15% gain. This means the selling price would have been $1450.\n* We need to find the loss percentage when the article was initially sold.\n\n**2. Set up an equation:**\n\n* Let 'x' be the original selling price.\n* The cost price is $1250.\n* The selling price with the gain would be $1450.\n\nWe know that: \n* Original selling price (x) - Loss percentage = Cost price \n* Increased selling price (x + $500) + 15% = $1450\n\n**3. Use the information about the gain:**\n\n* The gain of 15% means that the selling price increased by 15/100 * (x + $500) = $75 \n* We can now write the equation: (x + $500) + $75 = $1450\n\n**4.

Solve for 'x':**\n\n* -20 minutes = 20x \n* x = -20 minutes / 20 \n* **x = -1 minute**\n\n**Answer:** It takes Matt **-1 minute** to do a problem without a calculator. \n\n\n**Important Note:**  A negative time value doesn't make sense in this context. It suggests there's an error in the problem setup. It's possible there's a mistake in the given information, like the total time saved by using a calculator being incorrect. \n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define variables:**\n\n*  Let  'x' represent the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator. \n\n**2. Set up the equation:**\n\n*  Matt takes 2 minutes per problem with a calculator. \n*  He takes 'x' minutes per problem without a calculator.\n*  The total time with a calculator is 20 problems * 2 minutes/problem = 40 minutes.\n*  The total time without a calculator is 20 problems * x minutes/problem.\n*  We know that using a calculator saves him 60 minutes. Therefore: 40 minutes = 20 problems * x minutes/problem + 60 minutes \n\n**3. Solve for x:**\n\n*  Simplify the equation: 40 = 20x + 60\n*  Subtract 60 from both sides: -20 = 20x\n*  Divide both sides by 20: x = -1\n\n**Answer:** It takes Matt **-1 minute** to do a problem without a calculator. \n\n\n**Important:** The answer is negative because time cannot be negative.  This is a bit of a trick question.  It's important to remember that time cannot be negative. \n\n\n\n"
