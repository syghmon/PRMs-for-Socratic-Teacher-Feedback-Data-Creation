      "To solve this problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the hint and use the properties of similar triangles and the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the bases of the smaller trapezoids.\n\n1. **Identify Similar Triangles**:\n   Since the line parallel to the bases of the given right trapezoid splits it into two smaller trapezoids, each of which can have a circle inscribed in it, we can draw a line from the apex of the larger trapezoid to the center of the inscribed circle in each of the smaller trapezoids. These lines will be parallel to the bases of the smaller trapezoids and will form similar triangles.\n\n2. **Use Pythagorean Theorem**:\n   Let's denote the length of the bases of the smaller trapezoids as $x$ and $y$. The Pythagorean theorem can be applied to each of the smaller triangles to find the relationship between the lengths of the bases and the height of the trapezoid.\n\n   For the first smaller triangle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hypotenuse}^2 = \\text{Base}_1^2 + \\text{Height}^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (c-x)^2 = (\\frac{x+y}{2})^2 + d^2\n   \\]\n\n   For the second smaller triangle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hypotenuse}^2 = \\text{Base}_2^2 + \\text{Height}^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (c-y)^2 = (\\frac{x+y}{2})^2 + d^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set Up Equations**:\n   Since both triangles are similar, we can set up equations based on the proportions of the sides:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{c-x} = \\frac{y}{c-y}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(c-x)^2}{d^2} = \\frac{(c-y)^2}{d^2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the Equations**:\n   From the first equation, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{c-y}{y} \\cdot x\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{c}{y}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting this into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(\\frac{c}{y})^2}{d^2} = \\frac{(c-y)^2}{d^2}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{c^2}{y^2 d^2} = 1 - \\frac{2y^2}{d^2}\n   \\]\n   Solving for $y$, we find:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{d^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the Bases of the Original Trapezoid**:\n   The bases of the original trapezoid are equal to the sum and difference of the bases of the smaller trapezoids. Therefore, the bases of the original trapezoid are:\n   \\[\n   c + y = c + \\frac{d^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   c - y = c - \\frac{d^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying these, we get:\n   \\[\n   c + \\frac{d^2}{2} = \\frac{3d^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   c - \\frac{d^2}{2} = \\frac{d^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for $c$ and $d$, we find:\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{3d^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{2c}{3}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the bases of the original trapezoid are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{c = \\frac{3d^2}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d = \\frac{2c}{3}}\n\\]",
      "Let's denote the bases of the original trapezoid as $a$ and $b$, the height as $h$, and the radius of the inscribed circle as $r$.\n\n1. Consider the trapezoid $ABCD$ with bases $a$ and $b$, and height $h$. Let $E$ be the point of tangency of the inscribed circles in the two smaller trapezoids.\n\n2. In the right triangles $AEB$ and $BEC$, we have:\n   \\[\n   AE = \\frac{1}{2}r \\quad \\text{and} \\quad BE = \\frac{1}{2}r.\n   \\]\n\n3. By the Pythagorean theorem in triangle $AEB$, we have:\n   \\[\n   AB = \\sqrt{AE^2 + BE^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}r\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}r\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}r^2 + \\frac{1}{2}r^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}r^2 + \\frac{1}{2}r^2} = r.\n   \\]\n\n4. Similarly, in triangle $BEC$, we have:\n   \\[\n   BC = \\sqrt{BE^2 + CE^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}r\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}r\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}r^2 + \\frac{1}{2}r^2} = r.\n   \\]\n\n5. Therefore, the bases of the smaller trapezoids are $AE + BE = \\frac{1}{2}r + \\frac{1}{2}r = r$ and $BC - CE = r$.\n\n6. Since the bases of the smaller trapezoids are equal, we have $a + d = 2r$ and $b - d = 2r$.\n\n7. Solving these equations, we get:\n   \\[\n   a + d = 2r \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b - d = 2r.\n   \\]\n\n8. Adding these equations, we find:\n   \\[\n   a + b = 4r.\n   \\]\n\n9. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n   \\[\n   a - b = 2r.\n   \\]\n\n10. Adding the two equations, we find:\n    \\[\n    a + b = 4r \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a - b = 2r.\n    \\]\n\n11. Solving these equations, we get:\n    \\[\n    a = \\frac{6r}{5}.\n    \\]\n\n12. Similarly, solving the equations $a + d = 4r$ and $b - d = 4r$, we get:\n    \\[\n    d = \\frac{10r}{5} = 2r.\n    \\]\n\nThus, the bases of the original trapezoid are $\\frac{6r}{5}$ and $2r$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{a = \\frac{6r}{5} \\text{ and } d = 2r}$.",

      "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Similar Triangles**:\n   Since the line parallel to the bases of the trapezoid cuts it into two smaller trapezoids, the triangles formed by this line and the bases of the trapezoid are similar. The ratio of the corresponding sides of these similar triangles is equal to the ratio of their bases.\n\n2. **Similar Triangles Ratio**:\n   Given that the ratio of the bases of the smaller trapezoids is equal to the ratio of their heights (since they are formed by the same line), the ratio of the bases of the smaller trapezoids is equal to the ratio of their bases.\n\n3. **Pythagorean Theorem**:\n   Now, let's consider the right triangles formed by the smaller trapezoids.

The length of the hypotenuse of each right triangle is equal to the height of the trapezoid, and the lengths of the legs are equal to the bases of the trapezoids.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem in each right triangle, we can find the lengths of the bases of the smaller trapezoids:\n\n$$ a^2 + b^2 = h^2 $$\n$$ (\\frac{bc}{d})^2 + b^2 = h^2 $$\n\nWe can solve this equation for $b$:\n\n$$ b^2 = h^2 - (\\frac{bc}{d})^2 $$\n$$ b = \\sqrt{h^2 - (\\frac{bc}{d})^2} $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for $a$ into the equation for $b$:\n\n$$ b = \\sqrt{h^2 - (\\frac{bc}{d})^2} = \\sqrt{h^2 - (\\frac{bc}{d})^2} $$\n\nWe can see that $b$ is equal to the sum of the bases of the smaller trapezoids, which are equal to the sum and difference of the bases of the original trapezoid:\n\n$$ b = \\frac{c+d}{2} $$\n\nTherefore, the bases of the original trapezoid are $\\boxed{\\frac{c+d}{2}}$.",
      "1. Let's denote the bases of the trapezoid as \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. The line parallel to the bases splits the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids. Each smaller trapezoid will have a circle inscribed in it, and these smaller trapezoids are similar to the original trapezoid.\n3. Let the bases of the smaller trapezoids be \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), where \\( x + y = a \\) and \\( x - y = b \\).\n4. Solve the system of equations to find \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   \\begin{cases}\n   x + y = a \\\\\n   x - y = b\n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n   Adding the two equations, we get:\n   \\[\n   (x + y) + (x - y) = a + b \\implies 2x = a + b \\implies x = \\frac{a + b}{2}\n   \\]\n   Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n   \\[\n   (x + y) - (x - y) = a - b \\implies 2y = a - b \\implies y = \\frac{a - b}{2}\n   \\]\n5. The smaller trapezoids are similar to the original trapezoid. Using the similarity, we have the proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a - b}{a} = \\frac{x}{y}\n   \\]\n6. Substitute the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a - b}{a} = \\frac{\\frac{a + b}{2}}{\\frac{a - b}{2}}\n   \\]\n7. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a - b}{a} = \\frac{\\frac{a + b}{2}}{\\frac{a - b}{2}} = \\frac{a + b}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{a - b} = \\frac{a + b}{a - b}\n   \\]\n8. Since \\( a - b \\neq 0 \\) (the bases of the trapezoid cannot be equal), we can divide both sides by \\( a - b \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a - b}{a} = \\frac{a + b}{a - b} \\implies a^2 - b^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\implies 2b^2 = 2a^2 \\implies b^2 = a^2\n   \\]\n9. This implies that \\( b = a \\), which contradicts the given condition \\( c < d \\).\n10. Therefore, the solution \\( a = c \\) and \\( b = d \\) must be the correct solution.\n\nConclusion:\nThe bases of the original trapezoid are \\( c \\) and \\( d \\), where \\( c < d \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{c, d}\n\\]"

      "To find out how many hours it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone, we first need to determine the rate at which Ryan digs the hole.\n\nRyan's rate of digging is 1 hole per 10 ft * 10 ft = 100 square feet per hour.\n\nNow, we know that Castel can dig the hole in 6 hours. So, Castel's rate is 1 hole / 6 hours = 1/6 hole per hour.\n\nWhen Ryan and Castel work together, their combined rate of digging is the sum of their individual rates: 1/6 + 100 square feet per hour.\n\nLet's denote the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone as \"t\" hours. So, the combined rate when Ryan works alone is 100 square feet per hour.\n\nThe combined rate of Ryan and Castel working together is (1/6 + 100) square feet per hour.\n\nSince the combined rate when working together is the sum of their individual rates, and we know the combined rate when working together is 1/6 + 100, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(1/6 + 100) * t = 1/6 * t + 100 * t\n\nNow, we need to solve for \"t\".\n\nFirst, we'll combine the terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n(1/6 + 100) * t = (1/6 + 600/6) * t\n\nNow, we'll simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n(1/6 + 600/6) * t = (601/6) * t\n\nNow, we'll divide both sides by (1/6 + 600/6):\n\n(1/6 + 600/6) * t / (1/6 + 600/6) = (601/6) * t / (1/6 + 600/6)\n\nt = (601/6) * t / (1/6 + 600/6)\n\nt = (601/6) * t / ((1 + 600)/6)\n\nt = (601/6) * t / (601/6)\n\nt = t\n\nSo, when Ryan works alone, it takes him the same amount of time it takes for Castel to dig the hole alone, which is given as 2.72727272727 hours.\n\nTherefore, it takes Ryan $\\boxed{2.72727272727}$  hours to dig the hole alone.",

We need to find the value of \\\\( \\frac {\\sin (\\alpha+ \\frac {\\pi}{4})}{\\sin 2\\alpha+\\cos 2\\alpha+1}\\\\).\n\n3. First, we calculate \\\\(\\sin (\\alpha+ \\frac {\\pi}{4})\\\\).

Next, we calculate \\\\(\\sin 2\\alpha + \\cos 2\\alpha + 1\\\\). Using the double angle formulas for sine and cosine, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\sin 2\\alpha = 2\\sin \\alpha \\cos \\alpha = 2 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}\\right) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{8}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\cos 2\\alpha = 2\\cos^2 \\alpha - 1 = 2 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}\\right)^2 - 1 = \\frac{3}{8}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\sin 2\\alpha + \\cos 2\\alpha + 1 = -\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} + 1 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{15} - 1}{8} + 1 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{15} + 1}{8}\n   \\]\n\n5. Now, we substitute these values into the given expression:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\sin (\\alpha+ \\frac {\\pi}{4})}{\\sin 2\\alpha+\\cos 2\\alpha+1} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{8}}{\\frac{2\\sqrt{15} + 1}{8}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{2\\sqrt{15} + 1}\n   \\]\n\n6. Finally, we rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{2\\sqrt{15} + 1} \\cdot \\frac{2\\sqrt{15} - 1}{2\\sqrt{15} - 1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{30}(2\\sqrt{15} - 1)}{(2\\sqrt{15} + 1)(2\\sqrt{15} - 1)} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{45} - \\sqrt{30}}{45 - 1} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{45} - \\sqrt{30}}{44} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{9\\cdot 5} - \\sqrt{30}}{44} = \\frac{6\\sqrt{5} - \\sqrt{30}}{44}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{\\frac{6\\sqrt{5} - \\sqrt{30}}{44}}",

The problem statement says \"The sum of the house numbers on one side of a street from corner to corner is 117.\" This means that the sum of the house numbers on one side of the street is 117, and it doesn't necessarily mean that the first house number is \\( H = 20.4 \\).\n\nGiven the constraint that house numbers must be whole numbers, and considering that the sum of the house numbers on one side of the street from corner to corner is 117, the only possible solution that fits the given information is:\n\n\\[ H = 20 \\]\n\nSo the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section is \\( \\boxed{20} \\).",

      "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)\n\nwhere n is the number of terms.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of house numbers on one side of the street. Since we know the sum of the house numbers from one corner to the other is 117, and this is an arithmetic series with an odd number of terms (5 house numbers in this case), we can use the formula for the sum of an odd number of consecutive terms:\n\nSum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)\n\nHere, n is the number of terms, and we know that n = 5. The first term (a1) is the house number at one corner of the street, and the last term (an) is the house number at the other corner of the street.\n\nSum = (5/2) * (a1 + an)\n\nWe are given that the sum is 117, so we can set up the equation:\n\n117 = (5/2) * (a1 + an)\n\nTo find the value of a1 (the house number at one corner of the street), we can rearrange the equation:\n\na1 + an = 2 * (117 / 5)\na1 + an = 2 * 23\na1 + an = 46\n\nSince the house numbers increase consecutively, we know that the first house number is 1, the second is 2, and so on. Therefore, the last house number is 5.\n\nNow we can find the value of a1 (the house number at one corner of the street):\n\na1 = 46 - an\n\nSince an is the 5th house number, we can substitute an with 5 in the equation:\n\na1 = 46 - 5\na1 = 41\n\nSo the house number at one corner of the street is 41.\n\nNow we can find the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section:\n\nhouse number = a1 + 4\nhouse number = 41 + 4\nhouse number = 45\n\nTherefore, the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section is $\\boxed{45}$ .",

The total number of house numbers will be:\n\nTotal = (a + 4) + (a + 3) + (a + 2) + (a + 1) + a\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation.\nNow, we can simplify the equation by adding the numbers together:\n\nTotal = 5a + 10\n\nStep 5: Set the total equal to 117.\nSince the total sum of the house numbers is 117, we can set the equation equal to 117:\n\n5a + 10 = 117\n\nStep 6: Solve for 'a'.\nNow, we need to solve for 'a'.

When x is an integer, 2^x is an integer, and [x] is the same as x. Therefore, f(x) = 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 2^x - x - 1. For x = 0, f(0) = -1, and for x = 1, f(1) = 1. So, the function has only two distinct values.\n\n2. When x is a non-integer, 2^x is a real number, and [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x. The function f(x) will have a value between -1 and 0 for all non-integer x.\n\n3. When x is a negative integer, f(x) will be negative, since 2^x is positive and [x] is an integer.\n\nNow, let's examine the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0. This equation will have solutions for x if and only if the function f(x) has a value of 0. Since f(x) has only two distinct values for integer x and one value for non-integer x, the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 will have a solution for x if and only if the value of 2^x - 2[x] - 1 is 0.\n\nFor x = 0, f(0) = -1, so the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 has no solutions for x = 0.\n\nFor x = 1, f(1) = 1, so the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 has one solution for x = 1.\n\nFor all other values of x, f(x) will have a value between -1 and 0. Therefore, the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 will have a solution for x if and only if 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 has a solution for x.\n\nSince the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 has a solution for x if and only if 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 has a solution for x, the number of solutions to the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 is the same as the number of solutions to the equation 2^x - 2[x] = 1.\n\nNow, let's find the solutions to the equation 2^x - 2[x] = 1. This equation will have solutions for x if and only if the value of 2^x is 1.\n\nFor x = 0, 2^0 - 2[0] = 1, so x = 0 is a solution.\n\nFor x = 1, 2^1 - 2[1] = 1, so x = 1 is a solution.\n\nFor all other values of x, 2^x will be greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the equation 2^x - 2[x] = 1 has two solutions for x.\n\nSince the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 has a solution for x if and only if 2^x - 2[x] = 1 has a solution for x, the number of solutions to the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 is 2.",
      "Let's analyze the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0, where [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to the real number x. We'll first consider the behavior of the function f(x) = 2^x - 2[x] - 1.\n\nSince [x] is an integer, 2^[x] is either 1 or 2. Therefore, the function f(x) is either -1 or 0 for integer values of x.\n\nFor non-integer values of x, the behavior of f(x) can be analyzed by considering the range of values for 2^x. Since 2^x grows exponentially, the range of values for f(x) is the set of all real numbers less than or equal to 0, including 0 itself.\n\nNow, we'll determine the number of solutions to the equation f(x) = 0 by analyzing the range of values for x.\n\nFor 0 \u2264 x < 1, we have 2^x < 2, so f(x) = 2^x - 2[x] - 1 < 1. There is no solution for this range.\n\nFor 1 \u2264 x < 2, we have 2^x > 2, so f(x) = 2^x - 2[x] - 1 > 0. There are infinitely many solutions for this range.\n\nFor x \u2265 2, we have 2^x \u2264 2, so f(x) = 2^x - 2[x] - 1 \u2264 0. There are no solutions for this range.\n\nCombining the above information, we can conclude that the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 has infinitely many solutions for x \u2265 2 and no solutions for 0 \u2264 x < 1.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions to the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 is 0 (for x \u2264 2) + \u221e (for x \u2265 2) = \u221e.\n\nSo, the final answer is:",
      "To determine the number of solutions to the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0, we need to consider the behavior of 2^x - 2[x] - 1. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The function 2^x is strictly increasing for all real numbers x.\n2. The function [x] represents the greatest integer less than or equal to x, and it is also strictly increasing for all real numbers x.\n3. Therefore, the function 2^x - 2[x] - 1 is strictly decreasing for all real numbers x.\n\nNow, let's consider the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0. Since 2^x is strictly decreasing, the only way for this equation to have a solution is if 2^x = 2[x] + 1. This is only true when 2^x is equal to 1, 2, or 4, as these are the only values of x for which 2[x] + 1 equals 2^x.\n\nThe equation 2^x = 2[x] + 1 has exactly 3 solutions, which correspond to the values of x where 2^x = 1, 2, or 4. These are x = 0, x = 1, and x = 2, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 has exactly 3 solutions. The answer is:\n\n\\boxed{3}"

The least common multiple of 16 and 8 is 16, so we can rewrite 29/16 as 196/16.\n\nNow we can add the fractions:\n\nTotal weight = (196/16) + (14/16)\nTotal weight = 200/16\nTotal weight = 12.5 kg\n\nSo the bag and the chair, when cut into 2 meters and weighed together, have a total weight of $\\boxed{12.5}$  kilograms (kg).",
      "To find the combined weight of the bag and chair, we need to first find the weight of each piece when cut into 2 meters.\n\nThe bag is 5 meters long and weighs 29/8 kilograms. Cutting it into 2 meters:\nWeight of bag when cut = (5/2) * (29/8) = 5 * 29/16 = 145/16 kg\n\nThe chair is 4 meters long and weighs 2.8 kilograms. Cutting it into 2 meters:\nWeight of chair when cut = (4/2) * (2.8) = 4 * 1.4 = 5.6 kg\n\nNow, we add the weight of the bag and chair when cut into 2 meters:\nCombined weight = 145/16 + 5.6\nCombined weight = 9.0625 + 5.6 = 14.6625 kg\n\nSo, the bag and chair, when cut into 2 meters and weighed together, weigh approximately 14.6625 kilograms (kg).",
      "Step 1: Find the weight of the bag when cut into 2 meters (m).\nSince the bag is 5 meters (m) long and weighs 29/8 kilograms (kg), we can find the weight of the bag when cut into 2 meters (m) by dividing the total weight by 2.\n\nWeight of bag when cut into 2 meters (m) = (29/8) kg / 2\n\nStep 2: Find the weight of the chair when cut into 2 meters (m).\nSimilarly, we can find the weight of the chair when cut into 2 meters (m) by dividing the total weight by 2.\n\nWeight of chair when cut into 2 meters (m) = (2.8 kg) / 2\n\nStep 3: Find the total weight of the bag and chair when cut into 2 meters (m) and weighed together.\nNow that we have the weights of the bag and chair when cut into 2 meters (m), we can find the total weight by adding their individual weights together.\n\nTotal weight of bag and chair when cut into 2 meters (m) = (Weight of bag when cut into 2 meters (m)) + (Weight of chair when cut into 2 meters (m))\n\nTotal weight = (29/8) kg / 2 + (2.8 kg) / 2\n\nTotal weight = (29/16) kg + (2.8/2) kg\n\nTotal weight = (29/16) kg + 1.4 kg\n\nTotal weight = (29 + 256)/16 kg\n\nTotal weight = 285/16 kg\n\nFinal Answer: The total weight of the bag and chair when cut into 2 meters (m) and weighed together is 285/16 kilograms (kg).",
      "Step 1: Convert the length of the bag and chair to meters\nThe length of the bag is 5 meters, and the length of the chair is 4 meters.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the length of the bag and chair in 2 meters\nSince 1 meter = 2 meters, the length of the bag in 2 meters is 5 * 2 = 10 meters.\nThe length of the chair in 2 meters is 4 * 2 = 8 meters.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the weight of the bag and chair in 2 meters\nThe weight of the bag is 29/8 kilograms, and the weight of the chair is 2.8 kilograms.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total weight of the bag and chair in 2 meters\nTotal weight = weight of bag + weight of chair\nTotal weight = (29/8) + 2.8\n\nStep 5: Convert the weight of the bag and chair to kilograms\nTotal weight = (29/8) kg + 2.8 kg\nTotal weight = (3.625) kg + 2.8 kg\n\nStep 6: Calculate the total weight of the bag and chair in 2 meters\nTotal weight = 6.425 kilograms\n\nTherefore, the bag and chair, cut into 2 meters and weighed together, weigh 6.425 kilograms.",
      "Step 1: Calculate the weight of the bag after it is cut into 2 meters.\nSince the bag is 5 meters long, and it is cut into 2 meters, we can calculate the weight of the bag by dividing the total weight by the number of pieces.\n\nWeight of bag = Total weight / Number of pieces\nWeight of bag = 29/8 kg / 2 m\nWeight of bag = (29/8) / 2 kg\nWeight of bag = (29/8) * (1/2) kg\nWeight of bag = 29/16 kg\n\nStep 2: Calculate the weight of the chair after it is cut into 2 meters.\nSince the chair is 4 meters long, and it is cut into 2 meters, we can calculate the weight of the chair by dividing the total weight by the number of pieces.\n\nWeight of chair = Total weight / Number of pieces\nWeight of chair = 2.8 kg / 2 m\nWeight of chair = (2.8) / (2 * 1000) kg\nWeight of chair = (2.8) / 2000 kg\nWeight of chair = 0.0014 kg\n\nStep 3: Add the weight of the bag and the chair to find the total weight.\nTotal weight = Weight of bag + Weight of chair\nTotal weight = (29/16) kg + 0.0014 kg\n\nTo add these two numbers, we first need to convert the fractions to decimals:\n\nWeight of bag = 29/16 kg = 0.18125 kg\nWeight of chair = 0.0014 kg\n\nNow, add the two weights:\n\nTotal weight = 0.18125 kg + 0.0014 kg\nTotal weight = 0.18265 kg\n\nFinal answer: The bag and the chair weigh a total of 0.18265 kilograms (kg)."

The trader bought the car at a discount, so the price he paid is (100% - D) * P, where D is the discount percentage.\n3. He sold the car at a 100% increase on the price he bought it for, so the selling price is (1 + 100% * D) * (100% - D) * P.\n4. The trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price, so the profit is 60.00000000000001% * P.\n5. The profit can be expressed as the difference between the selling price and the price he bought it for: (1 + 100% * D) * (100% - D) * P - (100% - D) * P.\n6. Since the trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price, we can set up the equation: (1 + 100% * D) * (100% - D) * P - (100% - D) * P = 60.00000000000001 * P.\n\nNow let's solve the equation step by step:\n\n7. Simplify the equation: (1 + 100% * D) * (100% - D) * P - (100% - D) * P = 60.00000000000001 * P\n8. Distribute (1 + 100% * D) and (100% - D) in the equation: (100% - D) * P + 100% * D * P - P = 60.00000000000001 * P\n9. Combine like terms: P * (100% - D + 100% * D - 1) = 60.00000000000001 * P\n10. Simplify the equation: P * (100% + 99.99999999999999 * D - 1) = 60.00000000000001 * P\n11. Divide both sides by P: 100% + 99.99999999999999 * D - 1 = 60.00000000000001\n12. Simplify the equation: 99.99999999999999 * D = 60.00000000000001\n13. Divide both sides by 99.99999999999999: D = 60.00000000000001 / 99.99999999999999\n14. Simplify the fraction: D = 0.6000000000000001\n\nSo the discount percentage on the original price when he bought the car is approximately 60%.",
      "Let's denote the original price of the car as P.\n\nThe trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price. This means that the selling price is 1060.0000000000001% of the original price.\n\nThe trader sold the car at a 100% increase on the price he bought it. This means the selling price is equal to the price he bought it plus a 100% increase of the price he bought it.\n\nLet's denote the price he bought it as B. The selling price, S, is therefore B + 100% of B, which is B + B = 2B.\n\nGiven that the selling price S is 1060.0000000000001% of the original price P, we can write the equation:\n\nS = 1060.0000000000001% of P\n2B = 1060.0000000000001% of P\n\nSince S = 2B, we can set up the equation:\n\n2B = 2B\n\nThis equation confirms that the selling price is indeed double the price he bought it.\n\nNow, we know that the selling price S is equal to the price he bought it (B) plus a 100% increase of the price he bought it. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\nS = B + 100% of B\n2B = B + B\n\nThis equation confirms that the selling price is equal to the price he bought it plus a 100% increase of the price he bought it.\n\nSince we have two equations that are equal, we can conclude that the selling price S is equal to the price he bought it (B).\n\nTherefore, the discount percentage on the original price when he bought the car is zero.",
      "To find the discount percentage, we need to determine the price the trader paid for the car and then calculate the percentage of that price.\n\nLet's denote the original price of the car as P.\n\nThe trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price, so the selling price (SP) is P + 0.6000000000000001P = 1.6000000000000001P.\n\nThe trader sold the car at a 100% increase on the price he bought it, which means he sold it for P + P = 2P.\n\nSince the selling price (SP) is 2P, we can set up the following equation:\n\n2P = 1.6000000000000001P\n\nNow, we can solve for P:\n\n2P = 1.6000000000000001P\n2P - 1.6000000000000001P = 0\n0.4000000000000001P = 0\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.4000000000000001 to solve for P:\n\nP = 0 / 0.4000000000000001\nP = 0\n\nThis result is not possible because a car cannot be sold for zero dollars. Therefore, there might be an error in the given information. If the original price P is zero, then the trader bought the car for free. In this case, the discount percentage would be 0% on the original price.\n\nHowever, if the original price P is not zero, we need to look at the equation again. Let's rearrange it to solve for P:\n\n2P - 1.6000000000000001P = 0\n0.4000000000000001P = 0\nP = 0 / 0.4000000000000001\nP = 0\n\nThis also seems to be an error in the given information. If the original price P is not zero, we can conclude that the trader bought the car at a discount.\n\nThe discount percentage on the original price when the trader bought the car is:\n\nDiscount Percentage = (Discounted Price / Original Price) * 100\nDiscount Percentage = (0 / P) * 100\nDiscount Percentage = 0 * 100\nDiscount Percentage = 0\n\nThe discount percentage on the original price when the trader bought the car is 0%.",
      "To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Let's denote the original price of the car as \\( P \\).\n\n2. The trader bought the car at a certain discount, so the price he paid is \\( P - D \\), where \\( D \\) is the discount percentage.\n\n3. The trader then sold the car at a 100% increase on the price he bought it, which means he sold it at \\( P + D \\).\n\n4. The trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price, so the profit he made is \\( 1.6000000000000001 \\times P \\).\n\n5. We know that the profit is the difference between the selling price and the original price. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\n\\[ P + D = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P \\]\n\n6. To find the discount percentage \\( D \\), we'll rearrange the equation from step 5 to solve for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[ P + D = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P \\]\n\\[ P - P = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P - D \\]\n\\[ D = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P - P \\]\n\\[ D = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P - 1 \\]\n\n7. The discount percentage \\( D \\) is the difference between the price he bought it at and the selling price, expressed as a percentage of the original price. So we have:\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{1.6000000000000001 \\times P - 1}{P} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n8. We know the trader sold the car for 100% more than the price he bought it at, which is \\( P + D \\). Since the profit is 60.00000000000001% of the original price, we can express the selling price as:\n\n\\[ P + D = 1 + \\frac{60.00000000000001}{100} \\times P \\]\n\n9. Now we can equate the selling price from step 8 to the selling price from step 7:\n\n\\[ P + D = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P - 1 \\]\n\\[ P + D = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P - 1 \\]\n\\[ P - P + D = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P - 1 - P \\]\n\\[ D = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P - 1 - P \\]\n\\[ D = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P - P \\]\n\\[ D = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P - 1 \\]\n\n10. Now we can substitute \\( D \\) from step 9 into the equation from step 6:\n\n\\[ P + (1.6000000000000001 \\times P - 1) = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P \\]\n\\[ P + 1.6000000000000001 \\times P - 1 = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P \\]\n\\[ P - 1 = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P - 1 \\]\n\\[ -1 + 1 = 1.6000000000000001 \\times P - 1 - P \\]\n\\[ 0 =",

An ellipse is defined as the set of all points such that the sum of the distances from two fixed points (called foci) is constant.

The foci of the ellipse are located at a distance c from the center along the major axis, where c is given by c = $\\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}$ (where a is the length of the semi-major axis and b is the length of the semi-minor axis).\n\nGiven that the distance from P to one focus is 3, we can set up the following equation:\n\na + 3 = 3\n\nHowever, this is not possible because the sum of the distances from a point on an ellipse to its foci is always equal to the length of the major axis.

The total distance covered on gasoline is T - 40 miles.\n\n5. The gasoline used for the trip is 0.02 gallons per mile, so the total gasoline used is (T - 40) * 0.02 gallons.\n\n6. The total distance covered on electricity is 40 miles, so the total electricity used is 40 miles * 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 40 kWh.\n\n7.

We can set up an equation using the formula:\nAverage mileage = (Total distance) / (Total gallons of gasoline used)\n55 miles per gallon = (Total distance) / (0.02 gallons per mile)\n\nStep 5: Solve the equation for x.\nTo find the total gallons of gasoline used, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 0.02:\n0.02 * 55 miles per gallon = (Total distance)\nTotal gallons of gasoline used = 0.11 gallons\n\nNow we can solve for x:\nx = Total distance - Distance on battery\nx = 0.11 gallons * x miles / 0.02 gallons per mile\nx = 0.11x miles\n\nStep 6: Solve for x.\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.11:\nx = 0.11x miles\n0.9 = x\n\nStep 7: Calculate the total distance of the trip.\nNow that we know the distance traveled on gasoline is 0.9 miles, we can calculate the total distance of the trip:\nTotal distance = Distance on battery + Distance on gasoline\nTotal distance = 40 miles + 0.9 miles\nTotal distance = 40.9 miles\n\nSo, the total length of the trip was 40.9 miles."

We know that 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds.\n\nSo, 50 km/hour = (50 * 1000) m / 3600 s = 16.67 m/s (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance the train travels in 36 seconds:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time = 16.67 m/s * 36 s = 600.02 m (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nThe distance covered by the train is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. We know the length of the train is 360 meters. So, we can find the length of the bridge by subtracting the length of the train from the total distance:\n\nLength of the bridge = Distance - Length of the train\nLength of the bridge = 600.02 m - 360 m = 240.02 m\n\nTherefore, the length of the bridge is approximately 240.02 meters.",

Now, let's find the total amount invested in the second bond. Since the total savings before investing was $2750, the amount invested in the second bond is:\n   \\[\n   2750 - 1375 = 1375\n   \\]\n   The principal from the second bond is the remaining half of the total savings, so it is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2750}{2} = 1375\n   \\]\n   The interest from the second bond is:\n   \\[\n   I_2 = P * r * t\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   I_2 = 1375 * r\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, to find the interest from the compound interest bond, we subtract the total interest from the first bond from the total interest from the second bond:\n   \\[\n   I_{compound} = I_2 - I_1\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   I_{compound} = 1375 * r - 1375 * r = 0\n   \\]\n\nSo, Shawn received no interest from the compound interest bond.\n\nFinal answer: $\\boxed{0}$",

Subtracting $550 from both sides, we get $1375 * (1 + 2r_compound + r_compound^2) - $550 = $1375 * r_compound.\n12. Simplifying the equation, we get $1375 * r_compound = $550.\n13.

      "To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of files left after deleting 67 files: 256 - 67 = 189\n\n2. Determine the number of folders needed to hold 189 files. Since each folder contains 12 files, we'll divide 189 by 12 to find the number of folders: 189 / 12 = 15.75\n\n3. Since we can't have a fraction of a folder, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. This means Megan will end up with 16 folders.\n\n4.

Finally, we'll subtract the total number of files from the number of files Megan had at the beginning to find the number of files she put in the folders: 259 files - 189 files = 70 files\n\n7. Now, we'll divide the remaining 70 files by the number of files per folder (12) to find the number of folders: 70 files / 12 files/folder = 5.83\n\n8.

Using the given $|z_1| = |z_2| = 1$ and the fact that $|z_1 + z_2|^2 = (z_1 + z_2)(\\bar{z_1} + \\bar{z_2})$, we have:\n   \\[\n   |z_1 + z_2|^2 = (z_1 + z_2)(\\bar{z_1} + \\bar{z_2}) = (z_1 + z_2)(\\bar{z_1} + \\bar{z_2}) = 1^2 + 1^2 + 2\\text{Re}(z_1 \\bar{z_2})\n   \\]\n\n4.

Now, we need to find $|z_1 - z_2|$. We use the fact that the magnitude of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. Therefore, we can rewrite $|z_1 - z_2|$ as $\\sqrt{(z_1 - z_2)(\\bar{z_1} - \\bar{z_2})}$.\n\n6. Using the given $|z_1| = |z_2| = 1$ and the fact that $|z_1 - z_2|^2 = (z_1 - z_2)(\\bar{z_1} - \\bar{z_2})$, we have:\n   \\[\n   |z_1 - z_2|^2 = (z_1 - z_2)(\\bar{z_1} - \\bar{z_2}) = (z_1 - z_2)(\\bar{z_1} - \\bar{z_2}) = 1^2 + 1^2 - 2\\text{Re}(z_1 \\bar{z_2})\n   \\]\n\n7. Substituting $|z_1| = |z_2| = 1$ and $|z_1 - z_2| = |z_1 + z_2| = \\sqrt{3}$ into the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   1 + 1 - 2\\text{Re}(z_1 \\bar{z_2}) = 3 \\implies -2\\text{Re}(z_1 \\bar{z_2}) = 1 \\implies \\text{Re}(z_1 \\bar{z_2}) = -\\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n8.

We can write the equation for the new selling price as:\n\nSP_new = Original Selling Price + 15% of Original Selling Price\nSP_new = 1.15 * Original Selling Price\n\nSince the new selling price is the original selling price plus $500, we can write the equation as:\n\nSP_new = Original Selling Price + $500\n\nSubstituting the value of SP_new from the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\n1.15 * Original Selling Price = Original Selling Price + $500\n\nNow, let's solve for the Original Selling Price:\n\n1.15 * Original Selling Price - Original Selling Price = $500\n0.15 * Original Selling Price = $500\nOriginal Selling Price = $500 / 0.15\nOriginal Selling Price = $3333.33\n\nNow that we have the original selling price, we can calculate the loss percentage:\n\nLoss = Original Selling Price - Cost Price\nLoss = $3333.33 - $1250\nLoss = $1983.33\n\nLoss Percentage = (Loss / Original Selling Price) * 100\nLoss Percentage = ($1983.33 / $3333.33) * 100\nLoss Percentage = 0.6 * 100\nLoss Percentage = 60%\n\nTherefore, the loss percentage when the article was initially sold is $\\boxed{60\\%}$ .",
      "Let's denote the loss percentage when the article was initially sold as \"x\". The cost price of the article is $1250.\n\nThe tradesman sold the article at a certain loss percentage, which means that the selling price was less than the cost price. Let's denote the selling price when the loss was incurred as \"SP_loss\".\n\nAccording to the problem, if the selling price had been increased by $500, there would have been a gain of 15%. This means that the new selling price, which we'll call \"SP_gain\", would be the original selling price plus the $500 increase.\n\nSP_gain = SP_loss + $500\n\nSince the new selling price is the original selling price plus a 15% gain, we can write this as:\n\nSP_gain = SP_loss + 0.15 * SP_loss\nSP_gain = 1.15 * SP_loss\n\nNow, we can set up the equation:\n\nSP_gain = $1250 + $500\nSP_gain = $1750\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of SP_gain into the equation:\n\n1.15 * SP_loss = $1750\n\nTo find the original selling price, SP_loss, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.15:\n\nSP_loss = $1750 / 1.15\nSP_loss = $1500\n\nNow, we can find the loss percentage:\n\nLoss = SP_loss - Cost Price\nLoss = $1500 - $1250\nLoss = $250\n\nLoss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) * 100%\nLoss Percentage = ($250 / $1250) * 100%\nLoss Percentage = 0.2 * 100%\nLoss Percentage = 20%\n\nSo, the loss percentage when the article was initially sold was 20%.",

Therefore, the selling price when the gain occurs is S2 = (100 + 15)% of the cost price = 115% of $1250 = 1.15 * $1250 = $1437.50.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) S1 + $500 = $1437.50\n2) S1 = S2 - $500\n\nNow, let's solve the equations:\n\n1) S1 = $1437.50 - $500 = $937.50\n\nNow, we can find the loss percentage (x) by using the formula:\n\nLoss = (S1 / Cost Price) * 100\n\nLoss = ($937.50 / $1250) * 100 = 0.75 * 100 = 75%\n\nTherefore, the loss percentage when the article was initially sold is 75%.",

The degree of the remainder is one less than the degree of the divisor.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the degree of the dividend and the remainder\nThe degree of the dividend is 13.\nThe degree of the remainder is 7.\n\nStep 4: Find the degree of the divisor\nSince the degree of the quotient is one less than the degree of the dividend, we subtract 7 from 13 to find the degree of the divisor $d(x)$:\n\n\\[ \\deg d = \\deg \\text{quotient} - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \\]\n\nFinal answer: $\\boxed{6}$",
      "To find the degree of the divisor $d(x)$, we use the relationship between the degrees of the dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder in polynomial division. The degree of the dividend is $13$.\n\nLet's denote the degree of the divisor as $n$. According to the division algorithm, the degree of the quotient is $7$ and the degree of the remainder is $1$. The degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ n \\leq 7 \\]\n\nGiven that the degree of the remainder is $1$, we can write:\n\n\\[ 7 - 1 = 6 \\]\n\nThus, the degree of the divisor $d(x)$ is:\n\n\\[ \\deg d = 6 \\]\n\nFinal answer: $\\boxed{6}$",

In this case, the degree of the divisor $d(x)$ is $5$, so the degree of the remainder $r(x)$ must be less than $5$.\n\nGiven that the remainder $r(x)$ is $3x^3 + 4x^2 - x + 12$, the degree of the remainder must be $3$. Therefore, the degree of the divisor $d(x)$ must be $5$ minus the degree of the remainder, which is $3$.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$$\\deg d = \\deg p - \\deg r = 13 - 3 = \\boxed{10}$$"

We are also given that x is 48 percent of z. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ x = 0.48z \\]\n\n3. Since x is equal to 1.20y, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n\\[ 1.20y = 0.48z \\]\n\n4. Now, we want to find the percentage decrease of y compared to z.

      "Let's denote the percentage decrease of y compared to z as P%.\n\nWe know that x is 48% of z. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\nx = 0.48z\n\nWe also know that x is 20% more than y. So, we can write:\n\nx = y + 0.20y\n\nSubstituting x from the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\n0.48z = y + 0.20y\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\n0.48z = 1.20y\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage decrease of y compared to z. To do this, we'll first express y as a percentage of z:\n\ny/z = (1.20/1.00) * 100 = 120%\n\nSo, y is 120% of z. To find the percentage decrease of y compared to z, we subtract y from 100%:\n\nPercentage Decrease of y = 100% - 120% = -20%\n\nSince a decrease of 20% is not possible in this context (as x is 48% of z and y is 120% of z), we need to re-evaluate our initial assumption about the relationship between x and y.\n\nLet's assume that the percentage decrease of y compared to z is not as straightforward as we initially thought. Instead, let's assume that y is P% less than z. We can then express y as:\n\ny = z - (P/100) * z\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for x, we get:\n\nx = 0.48z = z - (P/100) * z + 0.20z\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 0.68z\n\nNow, we can express x as a percentage of z:\n\nx/z = (0.68/1.00) * 100 = 68%\n\nSo, x is 68% of z.

This can be expressed as:\n\nx = 0.48z\n\nNow, we can set the two expressions for x equal to each other:\n\n1.20y = 0.48z\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage decrease of y compared to z. To do this, we'll first find the ratio of y to z:\n\ny / z = 1.20 / 0.48\n\nNow, to find the percentage decrease, we'll take this ratio and subtract 1:\n\nPercentage Decrease = (y / z) - 1\nPercentage Decrease = (1.20 / 0.48) - 1\nPercentage Decrease = 2.5 - 1\nPercentage Decrease = 1.5\n\nTherefore, y is 150 percent of z, which means y is 150 percent of the original value of z.

      "Let's denote the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator as x minutes.\n\nFirst, let's find out how long it takes Matt to do a problem with a calculator. It takes him 2 minutes per problem, so it takes him 2 * x minutes to do all 20 problems with a calculator.\n\nSince using a calculator saves him 60 minutes, we can set up the equation:\n\n2 * x = 60\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\nx = 60 / 2\nx = 30\n\nSo, it takes Matt 30 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.\n\nFinal answer: Matt takes 30 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Step 1: Find out how many minutes a problem takes without a calculator.\nMatt saves 60 minutes using a calculator. Therefore, without a calculator, he takes 60 minutes to do 20 problems.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the time per problem without a calculator.\nTo find the time per problem without a calculator, we divide the total time saved by the number of problems:\n60 minutes / 20 problems = 3 minutes per problem.\n\nFinal Answer: Matt takes 3 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Let's denote the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator as \\( t \\) minutes.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much time Matt spends using a calculator on his assignment:\n\nTime spent with a calculator = Number of problems * Time per problem with calculator\nTime spent with a calculator = 20 * 2 = 40 minutes\n\nNow, we know that using a calculator saves Matt 60 minutes. So, the time saved by not using a calculator is:\n\nTime saved = Time spent with a calculator - Time saved with a calculator\nTime saved = 40 - 60 = -20 minutes\n\nThis result doesn't make sense because saving time is a positive quantity. This indicates that there must be an error in the problem statement or the solution. Please double-check the problem for accuracy.",
      "Let's denote the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator as x minutes per problem.\n\nSince Matt's assignment has 20 problems, the total time without a calculator for all 20 problems would be 20x minutes.\n\nAccording to the hint, using a calculator will save him 60 minutes. Therefore, the total time with a calculator for all 20 problems would be 20x - 60 minutes.\n\nSince using a calculator saves 60 minutes, we can write the equation as:\n\n20x - 60 = 20x\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n20x - 60 = 20x\n60 = 20x - 20x\n60 = 0x\n\nThis equation does not hold true because it suggests that using a calculator will always save 60 minutes, which is not the case. The correct interpretation of the hint is that using a calculator saves 60 minutes in total, but not necessarily for every problem.\n\nSo, the correct interpretation of the hint is that using a calculator saves 60 minutes in total for the entire assignment.\n\nTherefore, the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator is:\n\n60 minutes / 20 problems = 3 minutes per problem.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 3 minutes per problem.",
      "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total time Matt spends without a calculator. Since using a calculator saves him 60 minutes, we can find the total time spent without a calculator by subtracting the time saved from the total time.\n\nLet's denote the total time spent without a calculator as \\( T_{\\text{no calculator}} \\).\n\nWe know that Matt spends 2 minutes per problem with a calculator. Therefore, the total time spent with a calculator is \\( 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\) minutes.\n\nThe total time spent without a calculator is the difference between the total time and the time spent with a calculator:\n\n\\( T_{\\text{no calculator}} = \\text{Total time} - \\text{Time spent with a calculator} \\)\n\n\\( T_{\\text{no calculator}} = 60 \\) minutes (total time saved)\n\nNow, we can find the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator by dividing the total time spent without a calculator by the number of problems:\n\n\\( \\text{Time per problem without a calculator} = \\frac{T_{\\text{no calculator}}}{20} \\)\n\n\\( \\text{Time per problem without a calculator} = \\frac{60}{20} \\)\n\n\\( \\text{Time per problem without a calculator} = 3 \\) minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes Matt 3 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Let's call the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator \"x\" minutes.\n\nWith a calculator, Matt can do 20 problems in 2 minutes per problem * 20 problems = 40 minutes.\n\nWithout a calculator, it would take Matt 20 problems * x minutes per problem = 20x minutes.\n\nWe know that using a calculator saves Matt 60 minutes. So, without a calculator, it takes Matt 40 minutes + 60 minutes = 100 minutes.\n\nNow we can set up the equation:\n\n20x = 100\n\nTo find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:\n\nx = 100 / 20\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, it takes Matt 5 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Step 1: Let's denote the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator as T minutes.\n\nStep 2: Matt's time with and without a calculator will be represented by the following equations:\n- With a calculator: 2T minutes\n- Without a calculator: T minutes\n\nStep 3: According to the problem, using a calculator saves Matt 60 minutes. This means:\n- With a calculator: T minutes\n- Without a calculator: T - 60 minutes\n\nStep 4: Now we have two equations with two variables:\n1) T = 2T - 60\n2) T = T - 60\n\nStep 5: Let's solve the first equation for T:\nT = 2T - 60\n60 = T\n\nStep 6: We now know that Matt takes 60 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.\n\nFinal Answer: Matt takes 60 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
