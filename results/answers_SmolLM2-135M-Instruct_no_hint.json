This means that he can dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole in 6 * 10 = 60 feet in 6 hours.\n\nSince 60 feet / 100 feet / 10 hours = 0.6, we can see that the worker who can dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole in 6 hours is the faster worker.

      "To find the maximum value of the quadratic function y = -x^2 + 2x + m^2, we can use the method of completing the square. This involves adding and subtracting a fraction to the coefficient of the x^2 term, then dividing the entire equation by the denominator of the subtraction, and finally dividing the entire equation by the denominator of the division.\n\nLet's start by adding the coefficient of x^2 to the coefficient of the x term, which gives us -x^2 + 2x + m. We can then add the remaining terms, which are the x^2 terms, and divide by the denominator of the addition, resulting in -x^2 + 2x + 2x + m.\n\nNow, we can complete the square by adding and subtracting the fraction -x^2 + 2x + m.

We can then substitute the value of m into this formula to solve for m.\n\nFirst, let's find the roots of the quadratic equation. We can do this by factoring the quadratic expression:\n\n(x - (-1))(x + 1) = 0\n\nThis tells us that either (x - (-1)) = 0 or (x + 1) = 0. Solving for x, we get two possible values: x = -1 or x = 1.\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the maximum value of the function:\n\ny = (-x^2 + 2x + m^2) - (m)^2\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\ny = (-(-1)^2 + 2(-1) + m^2) - (m)^2\ny = (-1 + 2m + m^2) - (m^2)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ny = (-1 + 2m + m^2) - m^2\ny = (-1 + 2m + m^2) - 2m\ny = (-1 + 2m) + m^2\n\nNow, we can find the maximum value of the function by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function is 3 - 2m.\n\nTo express this in the form \u00b1\u221avalue, we can use the fact that \u221a(a) = \u00b1\u221ab if a = b. Let's simplify the expression:\n\n\u221a(3 + 2m) = \u00b1\u221a(3 + 2m)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the square root, we get:\n\n\u221a(3 + 2m) = 2\u221a3 + m\n\nNow, we can find the value of m by substituting the expression into the formula:\n\nm = \u221a(3 + 2m)\nm = 2\u221a3 + m\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function is 2\u221a3 + m.\n\nTo express this in the form \u00b1\u221avalue, we can use the fact that \u221a(a) = \u00b1\u221ab if a = b. Let's simplify the expression:\n\n\u221a(2 + 2m) = \u00b1\u221a(2 + 2m)\n\u221a(2 + 2m) = 2\u221a3 + m\n\nNow, we can find the value of m by substituting the expression into the formula:\n\nm = \u221a(2 + 2m)\nm = 2\u221a3 + m\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function is 2\u221a3 + m.\n\nThe quadratic function y = -x^2 + 2x + m^2 has a maximum value of 3, which occurs at the point where the quadratic expression is equal to zero.",

      "Let's analyze the triangle $\\triangle ABC$ step by step. We start by considering the triangle $\\triangle ABC$ with $BC=3$ and $AC=4$. We can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is constant, which is a fundamental property of triangles.\n\nLet's define $PA = 3$, $BP = 4$, and $PA^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 12 + 16 = 30$. Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, we have:\n\n$PA^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 12 + 16 = 30$\n\nSince $PA^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 12 + 16 = 30$, we can conclude that the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle is $\\sqrt{30}$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is constant to find the length of the median of the triangle. Since the median of a triangle is perpendicular to the base and is the longest segment, we can use the fact that the median of a triangle is perpendicular to the opposite side.\n\nLet's denote the median of triangle $\\triangle ABC$ as $m$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the length of the median:\n\n$m^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 12 + 16 = 30$\n\nSince $m^2 = 30$, we can conclude that the length of the median of triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\sqrt{30}$.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of $PA$, $BP$, and $PA^2$ to find the value of $PA$:\n\n$PA^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 12 + 16 = 30$\n\n$PA^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 12 + 16 = 30$\n\nSince the triangle is a right-angled triangle, we know that the median of the triangle is the median of the opposite side. Therefore, the median of the triangle is the perpendicular bisector of the hypotenuse, which is also the median of the triangle.\n\nSince the median of the triangle is the longest segment, it must be the hypotenuse of the triangle.

      "To determine the store's earnings, we need to calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers sold and then divide it by the number of pencils and erasers sold.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers:\n\n- For 20 pencils, the cost of the pencils is 20 * $1 = $20.\n- For 20 pencils, the cost of the erasers is 20 * $1 = $20.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of pencils + Cost of erasers\nTotal cost = $20 + $20\nTotal cost = $40\n\nTo find the store's earnings, we divide the total cost by the number of pencils and erasers sold:\n\nEarnings = Total cost / Number of pencils and erasers sold\nEarnings = $40 / 20\nEarnings = $2\n\nSo, the store earned $2 from selling pencils and erasers.",
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many pencils and erasers the store has. Since the store has 20 pencils and the erasers cost $1 each, we can find the number of pencils by dividing 20 by 1. So, 20 pencils are the number of pencils the store has.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many erasers the store sells. Since the store has 20 pencils and the erasers cost $1 each, we can find the number of erasers by dividing 20 by 1. So, 20 erasers are the number of erasers the store sells.\n\nNow, we can add these two numbers together to find the total amount the store earns. 20 pencils is equal to 20 x 10, which equals 200 pencils. 20 erasers is equal to 20 x 1, which equals 20 erasers.\n\nFinally, we can put the total amount of pencils and erasers in a box and add them together. 200 pencils is equal to 200 x 10, which equals 2000 pencils. 20 erasers is equal to 20 x 1, which equals 20 erasers.\n\nTherefore, the store earned 2000 pencils and 200 erasers.",
      "To find the total revenue earned, we need to calculate the cost of each item, then divide that cost by the quantity sold.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of each item:\n\n- For pencils, the cost is 1/2 pencils * $1 = $0.50\n- For erasers, the cost is 1/2 erasers * $1 = $0.50\n\nNow, we add the costs of pencils and erasers:\n\n- For pencils, the total cost is $0.50 + $0.50 = $0.10\n- For erasers, the total cost is $0.50 + $0.50 = $0.10\n\nSo, the store earned $0.10 in revenue from selling pencils and erasers.",
      "To determine the store's earnings, we need to calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers sold.\n\nFor pencils, the cost per pencil is $1.50, and the cost per pencil is $0.75, so the total cost is $1.50 * $0.75 = $1.25.\n\nFor erasers, the cost per eraser is $0.25, and the cost per eraser is $0.15, so the total cost is $0.25 * $0.15 = $0.06.\n\nSince the store sold 20 pencils, we can calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers as follows:\n\nTotal cost = Number of pencils * Cost per pencil\nTotal cost = 20 pencils * $1.50\nTotal cost = $25\n\nTotal cost = $25\n\nThe store earned $25 from selling pencils and erasers."

      "To write a general term formula for this sequence, we can start by noting that the sequence is obtained by adding a constant $c$ to the previous term, starting from the second term. The sequence is then obtained by adding a constant $d$ to the previous term, starting from the last term.\n\nLet's denote the first term as $a_1$, the second term as $a_2$, and so on. The general term formula is then $$\\label{term_formula} \\text{term}_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{c}{d^n}$$\n\nThis formula can be derived by summing the terms of the sequence, which is equivalent to the sum of the sequence itself, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c^n$. The key insight is that the sum of a sequence is equal to the sum of its terms, and the constant $c$ is the same for all terms.\n\nTherefore, we can write the general term formula as $$\\label{term_formula} \\text{term}_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{c^k}{d^n}$$\n\nThis formula can be applied to any term in the sequence. For example, if we start with the first term $a_1$, the second term is $a_2 = a_2 + c^2 = 12$, so the general term formula becomes $a_n = 12 + c^n$.\n\nIt's worth noting that this formula is valid for any term in the sequence, as long as the constant $c$ is not zero. This is because the formula will always return the same term for the same constant $c$.",

The sequence continues to the nth term, so the nth term is:\n\n$a_{n+1} = 3 + 1 = 4$\n\n3. The sequence goes on indefinitely, so the nth term is:\n\n$a_{n+1} = 4$\n\n4.

Therefore, we have:\n\n$s = 2 + (n-1)(-6) = 2 - 6(-6) = 2 - 24 = -12$\n\nSo, the general term formula for the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is:\n\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_",

      "Let's break down the inequality $x^2 - 2x - 2 - m < 0$ to understand its range. The inequality is a quadratic inequality with the constraint $m < 2$, which means that the variable $m$ must be less than or equal to $2$. This implies that $m$ cannot be negative, since $m$ cannot be less than $2$.\n\nWe can start by considering the sign of $m$ in relation to the entire inequality. If $m$ is positive, then $x^2$ is positive, so $x^2 - 2x - 2 - m > 0$. If $m$ is negative, then $x^2$ is negative, so $x^2 - 2x - 2 - m < 0$.

This inequality is a quadratic inequality, so we can factor it as (x - 2)(x + 2) < 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the square root of both sides: $x - 2$ and $x + 2$ are real numbers. The square root of a real number is non-negative, so $x - 2$ is non-negative.

      "To solve the inequality, we first need to find the endpoints of the solution set.

      "To solve this inequality, we first need to determine the values of $a$ and $b$. The inequality is $x - a > 0$ and $x - b > 0$.\n\nNext, we can find the values of $a$ and $b$ such that the inequality is satisfied. For $a = 1$, the inequality becomes $x - 1 > 0$, which simplifies to $x > 0$.\n\nFor $a = -\\infty$, the inequality becomes $x - -a > 0$, which simplifies to $x > 0$.\n\nFor $a = +\\infty$, the inequality becomes $x - -a > 0$, which simplifies to $x > 0$.\n\nNow, we can find the value of $b$ that satisfies the inequality. Using the properties of inequalities, we know that $x - a > 0$ and $x - b > 0$, so we can set these equal to each other: $x > 0$ and $x > -a$. Therefore, we have $x > -a$.\n\nFinally, we need to find the values of $a$ and $b$ such that $x > 0$ and $x > -a$. We can use the fact that $x - a > 0$ and $x - b > 0$ and the fact that $x > 0$ and $x > -a$ for all $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So, we have:\n\n$x > -a$ and $x > a$.\n\nSince $x > -a$ and $x > a$, we can conclude that $x > 0$.\n\nNow, we can find the value of $a + b$. We can write this as:\n\n$a + b = x - a$\n\n$x - a$ is a constant, so we can set $x - a$ equal to $x - a$:\n\n$x - a$ = x - a$\n\n$a$ is a constant, so we can set $a$ equal to $0$:\n\n$x$ = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for $a$ and $b$. We can solve this by equating the two expressions:\n\n$x - a$ = x - 0$\n\n$x$ = 0\n\nNow, we can find $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the inequality:\n\n$a + b$ = 0$\n\n$a + 0$ = 0$\n\n$a$ = 0\n\nSo, the solution set of the inequality is $(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, +\\infty)$."

The coordinates of the vertices are given by the equation $x=a+b+c$, where $x$ is the length of the base of the triangle and $y$ is the length of the height.\n\nSince $a=9$, $b=10$, and $c=12$, we can plug these values into the equation $x=a+b+c$. This gives us $x=9+10+12$.\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$:\n\n$x=9+10+12=15$\n\nFinally, we can find the coordinates of the vertices of triangle $ABC$:\n\n$(9,15)$\n$(10,15)$\n$(12,15)$\n\nSo, the shape of the triangle $\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_$ is $15\\pm 15$.\n\nTo put your final answer in \\boxed{}, we add the coordinates of the vertices:\n\n$15\\pm 15=15$\n\nTherefore, the shape of $\\triangle ABC$ is a triangle with vertices $15\\pm 15$ and $\\pm 15$.",
      "To solve this problem, we first need to find the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle. We know that $a=9$, $b=10$, $c=12$, so the coordinates of the vertices are given by $(9,10), (10,12), (12,10), (12,12)$.\n\nNext, we need to find the coordinates of the median to $BC$ from $a$ to $c$. We can use the fact that the median to a line is perpendicular to the line segment joining the midpoints of the line segment and the endpoints of the line segment. In this case, the median to $BC$ is the line segment that is perpendicular to the line segment joining the midpoints of the line segment and the endpoints of the line segment.\n\nThe midpoint of the line segment is $(a+b)/2, (a+c)/2).$ Since $a+b=9$ and $b+c=10$, we can find the midpoint of the line segment by subtracting $9$ from both sides: $(a+b)/2-9=10-9, 10-9=1, 10-10=0$. Therefore, the midpoint of the line segment is $(10,0).$\n\nNext, we need to find the coordinates of the median to $AC$. Since $a+c=12$, the midpoint of the line segment is $(12+c)/2, (12+b)/2).$ Since $a+c=10$, we can find the midpoint of the line segment by subtracting $10$ from both sides: $(12+b)/2-10=10-12, 10-10=0, 10-10=0$. Therefore, the midpoint of the line segment is $(10,0).$\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of the median to $ABC$ by adding $10$ to both sides: $(10+c)/2+10=10+10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=10, 10+10+10=",
      "To determine the shape of $\\triangle ABC$, we need to analyze the given constraints.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- $a = 9$ (height of the triangle)\n- $b = 10$ (base of the triangle)\n- $c = 12$ (height of the triangle)\n\nWe can start by determining the length of the side of the triangle. Since $a = 9$, we know that $c = 12 - a$. So, the length of the side of the triangle is $c = 12 - 9 = 3$.\n\nNow, we know that the height of the triangle is $a$. So, the height of the triangle is $a$.\n\nSince we know the lengths of the sides of the triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nApplying the Pythagorean theorem to the triangle, we get:\n\n$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$\n$c^2 = 3^2 + 12^2$\n$c^2 = 9 + 144$\n$c^2 = 157$\n\nTherefore, the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle is $3 \\cdot 12 = 36$.\n\nNow that we have the length of the side of the triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the altitude of the triangle. The altitude of a right-angled triangle is the line segment joining the right angle to the hypotenuse.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:\n\n$36^2 = a^2 + b^2$\n$36^2 = 9^2 + 12^2$\n$2766 = 299 + 281$\n$2766 = 508$\n$2766 = 1008$\n\nSo, the altitude of the triangle is $1008$.\n\nFinally, we can find the area of the triangle by using the formula:\n\n$A = \\frac{1}{2}ab$\n$A = \\frac{1}{2}(9)(1008) = 1440$\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is $1440$.\n\nSince the shape of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_$, we can conclude that it is a right-angled triangle with a side length of $36$, a base length of $10$, and a height of $12$.",

      "To solve this problem, let's first analyze the given equation. We have $3a+b=0$. We can rewrite this as $3a+b=0-6a-2b$. Now, we want to find the maximum value of $3a+b$ on the interval $[0, 6]$.\n\nWe can start by isolating $3a+b$ on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $b$ from both sides, resulting in $3a+b=\\frac{6}{2} - 6a$. This gives us $3a+b=0$.\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of $3a+b$, so we need to find the largest value of $b$. Since $b$ is positive, $b$ must be greater than $3a$. Therefore, the maximum value of $3a+b$ is $3a+b>3a+3a$.\n\nFinally, we need to find the largest value of $a$, which is $9a^{2}$. Since $9a^{2}=3a+3a$, we have $9a^{2}=3a+3a=10a$. So, the largest value of $a$ is $9a=10a$.\n\nPutting it all together, the maximum value of $3a+b$ is $3a+b>10a$.",

This is a geometric series, where $a$ is the first term and $b$ is the common ratio. The sum of a finite geometric series is given by the formula $a(1-r^{n+1})/(1-r)$, where $n$ is the number of terms and $r$ is the common ratio. In this case, $a(1-r) = 3a+b$, so $a(1-r) = 3(b+1)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the first $n$ terms of the geometric series. Since $9a^{2}+b^{2}-6a-2b=0$, we can write $9a^{2}=15b-6a-2b$. Subtracting $6a-2b$ from both sides, we get $15b-6a-2b=0$. Simplifying this equation, we get $15b-6a=0$.\n\nDividing both sides by $6a$, we get $b=12$. Therefore, the maximum value of $3a+b$ is $3(12) = 36$.\n\nTo put this in a more general form, we can say that the maximum value of $3a+b$ is $36$.\n\nNow that we have found the maximum value, we can use it to find the maximum value of $3a+b$ in the interval [0,9] to find the maximum value of $3a+b$."

      "To find the value of the real number $m$, we need to determine the slope of the line perpendicular to the given line. The slope of a line is a measure of its steepness and can be found using the formula:\n\n$$m = \\frac{y2 - y1}{(x - x_1)^2 + (y - y_1)^2}$$\n\nIn this case, the given line is $x+y-m=0$, and the given line is perpendicular to $x+(3-2m)y=0$. We can see that the slope of the line perpendicular to $x+(3-2m)$ is $m=1/2$.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $m$. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\n$$m = \\frac{y_1 - y_2}{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$\n\nIn this case, we have $y_1 = m$ and $y_2 = 1/2$. We can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n$$m = \\frac{1/2 - m}{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$$m = \\frac{1/2 - m}{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = \\frac{1}{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$\n\nNow, we can find the value of $m$.

      "To find the value of the real number $m$, we need to solve the given equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope of the given line. We can do this by finding the derivative of the equation $x+y-m=0$. Using the power rule of differentiation, we get:\n\n$m = \\frac{d(x+y)}{d(x)} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope form of a line, which is $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope and $x_1$ is the given point. So, we have:\n\n$(m, m) = (1, 0) \\implies m = 1$\n\nNext, we need to find the point of intersection between the line and the given line. We can do this by finding the y-intercept of the line. The y-intercept is the value of $m$ at the point where the line intersects the given line. Using the point-slope form of a line, we can write:\n\n$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\implies y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\implies y = m(x - x_1)$\n\nNow, we can substitute the point of intersection $(x_1, y_1)$ into the equation of the line:\n\n$(m, m) = (1, 0) \\implies m = 1$\n\nFinally, we can find the value of the real number $m$ by plugging the value of $m$ back into the equation of the line:\n\n$m = 1$\n\nSo, the value of the real number $m$ is $1$.",
      "To find the value of the real number $m$, we can use the point-slope form of a line, which is $y - m = m - y = 0$. This form allows us to express the line in slope-intercept form, which is $m = 0$.\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope form to find the equation of the line. Let's denote the point of intersection as $(x',y') = (2,0)$. Then, we have the equation of the line as $y - m = 0$.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation of the line in slope-intercept form by adding $m$ to both sides: $y = mx + 0$. Then, we can substitute the point $(x',y') = (2,0)$, which gives us $y - 0 = m + 0$, which simplifies to $y = m$.\n\nSo, the equation of the line is $y = m$. To find the value of $m$, we need to substitute $m = 0$ into the equation: $y = 0$. This gives us the point $(0,0)$ of intersection.\n\nTherefore, the value of the real number $m$ is $0$.",
      "To find the value of the real number $m$, we first need to determine the slope of the given line. The slope is the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run) along the line. The slope of the given line is $m=1/4$, which means that the distance between the point $(x+y-m, x+y-m)=(3,0)$ and the line $x+(3-2m)y=0$ is 1/4.\n\nSince the line is perpendicular to the given line, the line $x+(3-2m)y=0$ is also perpendicular to the line $x+y-m=0$, so the slope of the line is $m=1/4$.\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the line $x+(3-2m)y=0$. To do this, we can use the slope formula: $m=(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)$, where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the points $(-m,0)$, $(-m,0)$, and $m=1/4$.\n\nSo, the slope of the line is $m=(0-0)/((-1)(1/4)) = 0/4 = 0$.\n\nFinally, we can find the value of the real number $m$ by plugging in the values of $m$: $m=0$ is not the answer, but $m=0$ is the answer. Therefore, the value of the real number $m$ is $0$.",

      "Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two containers, each 5 meters long and weighing 29/8 kilograms.

The diagonal is equal to the hypotenuse of a right triangle, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal.\n\nThe diagonal of the parallelogram is equal to the hypotenuse of the right triangle, which is 30 meters. The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (30) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs (the two sides of the triangle).\n\nWe can use this relationship to find the length of the diagonal. The diagonal of the parallelogram is equal to the hypotenuse of the right triangle, so we can write: 30^2 = 30^2 + 20^2. \n\nExpanding the left side, we get: 900000 = 900000 + 200000.\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get: 1800000 = 1800000 + 200000.\n\nFactoring out the 200000, we get: 1800000 = 180000 + 400000.\n\nCombining the terms, we get: 1800000 = 2400000.\n\nNow, we can solve for the length of the diagonal: 2400000 / 1800000 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the area of the parallelogram is 10 square meters.",

      "To determine the discount percentage on the original price when the trader bought the car, we need to calculate the discount percentage based on the given information.\n\nFirst, we know that the trader bought the car at a 100% increase on the original price, so the price he bought the car at is 100% of the original price. So, the price the trader bought the car at is 100%.\n\nWe are also given that the trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price. This means that the price the trader bought the car at is 60.00000000000001% of the original price.\n\nTo calculate the discount percentage, we need to divide the profit by the original price and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nDiscount percentage = (60.00000000000001% of original price) / original price * 100\nDiscount percentage = 0.600000000000001% of original price\n\nNow, we can find the discount percentage by multiplying the discount percentage by 100:\n\nDiscount percentage = (0.600000000000001% of original price) * 100\nDiscount percentage = 0.600000000000001% of original price * 100\nDiscount percentage = 0.600000000000001% of original price * 100\nDiscount percentage = 0.600000000000001% of original price\n\nSo, the trader bought the car at a 100% increase on its original price and made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price.",
      "Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nThe trader bought the car at a discount of 100% on its original price. This means the car is now at its original price after being discounted.\n\nTo find the discount percentage, we need to calculate the original price of the car and the discount price. The original price is the original price before the discount, which is 100% of the discounted price. The discount price is the original price minus the discount price. So, the discounted price is 100% - 100% = 0%.\n\nNow, we can calculate the discount percentage by dividing the original price by the discounted price. The discount percentage is 60.00000000000001% of the original price. \n\nTo convert the percentage to a decimal, we multiply by 100. So, the discount percentage is 0.0600000000000001% * 100 = 0.600000000000001%. \n\nTherefore, the discount percentage on the original price when the trader bought the car was 0.600000000000001% of the original price.",

Since cos(x - \u03c0/2) is equal to cos(x + \u03c0/2) for any value of x, we can substitute these expressions into the sine function.\n\nSo, we have sin(x) = sin(x + \u03c0/2) = sin(x)cos(x - \u03c0/2) = cos(x)cos(x - \u03c0/2) = cos(x + \u03c0/2)cos(x - \u03c0/2).\n\nNow, we can use the fact that sin(x + \u03c0/2) = sin(x)cos(x - \u03c0/2) for any value of x. Since sin(x) is a periodic function, its derivative is also a periodic function, and its derivative is cos(x)cos(x - \u03c0/2).\n\nTherefore, we have cos(x)cos(x - \u03c0/2) = cos(x)cos(x - \u03c0/2) = cos(x + \u03c0/2)cos(x - \u03c0/2).\n\nSince cos(x + \u03c0/2) = cos(x)cos(x - \u03c0/2), we can substitute this into the equation for cos(x)cos(x - \u03c0/2) = cos(x)cos(x - \u03c0/2).\n\nThis gives us cos(x)cos(x - \u03c0/2) = cos(x)cos(x - \u03c0/2) = cos(x + \u03c0/2)cos(x - \u03c0/2).\n\nSince cos(x + \u03c0/2) = cos(x)cos(x - \u03c0/2), we have cos(x)cos(x - \u03c0/2) = cos(x + \u03c0/2)cos(x - \u03c0/2).\n\nThis shows that the sine function is always increasing, and therefore f(x) = sin(x) always holds true for any value of x.",

      "To solve this problem, let's first rewrite the original equation $y=-2x^{2}$ in the form $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation in this form by subtracting $-2$ from both sides, which gives us $y=m(x-1)+b$.\n\nNow, we want to find the value of $b$ that makes the equation true. We can do this by plugging $x=1$ into the equation, which gives us $y=m(1-1)+b$. This equation is in the form $y=m(x-1)+b$, so we can rewrite it as $y=m(x-1) + b$.\n\nSince $m$ is the slope of the parabola, and $b$ is the y-intercept, we can find the value of $b$ by subtracting $m$ from $x$. This gives us $x-1=1-b$, so $x=1-b$.\n\nNow that we have $x=1-b$, we can substitute it back into the original equation to find the value of $b$:\n\n$y=-2(1-b)+b$\n$y=-2(1-b) + b$\n$y=-2 + b$\n\nSo, the correct solution is $b=2$.",

This point of intersection is given by $y = -2x^{2} + 2x = -2(x^{2} + 3) + 2x$.\n\nTo find the equation of the line perpendicular to the original parabola, we can use the point-slope form of a line: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$. In this case, the slope is $m = -2$, and the x-coordinate of the point of intersection is $x_1 = -2$.\n\nThe equation of the line perpendicular to the original parabola is:\n\n$y - y_1 = -2(x - x_1) = -2(x - 2) + 2x = x - 2$\n\nSo, the equation of the line perpendicular to the original parabola is $y = x - 2$.",

This means that $y$ is now shifted 3 units to the right and 1 unit up.\n\nNow, I will use the fact that the product of the x-coordinates of the shifted points is equal to the product of the x-coordinates of the shifted points. So, I will multiply the x-coordinates of the shifted points together to get $y$ and then multiply the x-coordinates of the shifted points together to get $y$.\n\nSince $y$ is shifted 1 unit to the right and 3 units up, I will multiply the x-coordinates of the shifted points together to get $y$ and then multiply the x-coordinates of the shifted points together to get $y$.\n\nTherefore, I will multiply the x-coordinates of the shifted points together to get $y$ and then multiply the x-coordinates of the shifted points together to get $y$.\n\nSo, the final answer is $y=1+3y$, which is the same as $y=-2x^{2}$.",

Since $\\triangle ABC$ is a right-angled triangle, we know that the sum of the lengths of any two sides is equal to the length of the third side. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n$s/2 = (s/2)^2 + s/2$\n\nNow, we can solve for $s/2$. We can multiply both sides by $2$ to get rid of the fraction:\n\n$s/2 = 2s$\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $2$ to get the length of the hypotenuse:\n\n$s = \\sqrt{2}$\n\nSo, the smallest angle of the triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.",

      "To find the angle of the triangle, we can use the law of cosines, which relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. The law of cosines states that $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(C)$, where $C$ is the angle opposite side $a$ and $C'$ is the angle opposite side $b$.\n\nSince we know the lengths of the sides of the triangle are $a=4$, $b=3$, and $c=2$, we can use the formula for the cosine of an angle, which is $cos(A) = \\frac{a}{a} + \\frac{b}{b} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values: $a=4$, $b=3$, and $c=2$ into the formula: $cos(A) = \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nSo, the angle of the triangle is $\\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNote that this angle is the same as the angle opposite side $a$ in the original triangle, which we found earlier to be $\\frac{1}{2}$.",

      "To find the smallest angle of a triangle, we first need to find the measure of the largest angle. The largest angle in a triangle is the angle opposite the longest side. In triangle $\\triangle ABC$, the largest angle is the angle opposite the hypotenuse. Therefore, the largest angle of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\angle ABC$, which is the opposite angle of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nNow, to find the measure of the smallest angle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The smallest angle is $\\angle ABC$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Applying this to triangle $\\triangle ABC$, we have:\n\n$c^2 = 4^2 + 3^2 = 16 + 9 = 25$\n\n$abc^2 = 16 + 9 = 25$\n\nTherefore, the smallest angle of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\angle ABC$, which is the opposite angle of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nNow, to put your final answer in \\boxed{}, we substitute the value of $\\angle ABC$ with the value of $\\angle ABC$.\n\n$(\\angle ABC)^2 = (4)^2 + (3)^2 = 16 + 18 = 36$\n\n$(\\angle ABC)^2 = 36$\n\n$\\angle ABC = \\frac{36}{4}$\n\nTherefore, the smallest angle of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{36}{4}$."

However, since $f(x)=2^x-3$ is an odd function, we can see that $f(x)$ will cross the $x$-axis at least once when $x$ is less than $0$ or greater than $-1$.\n\nSo, we can conclude that $f(x)$ crosses the $x$-axis at least once, and $f(-2)+f(0)=2^(-2)+2(0)+2=2^(-1)+2=f(-2)+f(0)=2^(-1)+2=f(-2)+f(0)$.\n\nIn other words, $f(-2)+f(0)=\\frac{2^(-1)+2}{2}=f(-2)+f(0)=2^(-1)+2=f(-2)+f(0)=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=f(-2)+f(0)=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=f(-2)+f(0)=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=f(-2)+f(0)=2^(-1)+2=f(-2)+f(0)=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=f(-2)+f(0)=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=2^(-1)+2=",

The key property is that the derivative of an odd function is always positive, and the derivative of $2^x-3$ is $-2^x-3$.\n\nThe derivative of $2^x-3$ is $2^x-3$.

      "To solve this problem, let's start by analyzing the given information. We know that $F(x) = ax^7 + bx^5 + cx^3 + dx - 6$. We also know that $F(-2) = 10$.\n\nWe can start by using the given information to find $F(-2)$. Subtracting $2$ from both sides of the equation gives us $F(-2) = a(-2)^7 - b(-2)^5 + c(-2)^3 + dx - 6$. Now, we can rearrange this equation to solve for $F(x)$ by dividing both sides by $a - b$.\n\n$F(x) = -2x^7 + 2x^5 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 6$\n\nNow, let's solve for $F(x)$. Multiplying both sides of the equation by $-1$ gives us $-2x^7 - 2x^5 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 6 = 0$. This equation can be factored as $-x^7 + 2x^5 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 6 = 0$.\n\nNow, we can solve for $F(x)$ by solving the quadratic equation. We can start by factoring the quadratic expression $-x^7 + 2x^5 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 6 = 0$. Factoring the quadratic expression gives us $-x^7 + 2x^5 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 6 = 0$.\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation. The quadratic formula states that for a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the roots are given by $x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a$.\n\nIn this case, $b^2 - 4ac$ is $-2a$, so $x = (-2a + \u221a(4a^2 - 4*2*2*1)) / 2a$ gives us two roots.\n\nNow, we can substitute the roots into the equation $-2x^7 + 2x^5 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 6 = 0$. Combining the two roots gives us the equation $-2x^7 + 2x^5 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 6 = 0$.\n\nFinally, we can solve for $F(x)$ by solving the quadratic equation. Multiplying both sides of the equation by $-1$ gives us $-2x^7 + 2x^5 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 6 = 0$. This equation can be factored as $-x^7 + 2x^5 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 6 = 0$.\n\nNow, we can solve for $F(x)$. Multiplying both sides of the equation by $-1$ gives us $-x^7 + 2x^5 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 6 = 0$. This equation can be factored as $-x^7 + 2x^5 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 6 = 0$.\n\nNow, we can solve for $F(x)$ by solving the quadratic equation.

      "Chuck rides 3 hours total on a bicycle trip into the country and returns at the rate of 24 mph.\n\nTo find his speed, we can use the formula for speed:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nWe already know that Chuck rode 28.8 miles into the country and returned at the rate of 24 mph.\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 28.8 miles / 24 mph\nTime = 1.08 hours\n\nSo, Chuck rode out at a speed of 1.08 hours.\n\nTo find his speed when he rode out, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 3 hours / 1.08 hours\nSpeed = 2.88 miles per hour\n\nSo, Chuck rode out at a speed of 2.88 miles per hour.\n\nNow, to put your final answer into \\boxed{}, we can multiply the speed by the total distance:\n\nSpeed * Total Distance = 2.88 miles per hour * 3 hours\nSpeed * 3 hours = 9.36 miles per hour\n\nSo, Chuck rode out at a speed of 9.36 miles per hour.",
      "Step 1: Determine the total distance Chuck rode.\nChuck rode 3 hours and 30 miles, so his total distance is 3 * 30 = 90 miles.\n\nStep 2: Determine the speed Chuck rode.\nChuck rode at 24 mph, so his speed is 24 mph / 30 miles = 0.75 mph.\n\nStep 3: Calculate Chuck's speed when he rode out.\nChuck rode 28.8 miles into the country (rounded to the nearest hundredth), so his speed is 28.8 mph / 28.8 miles = 1.25 mph.\n\nStep 4: Determine the total distance Chuck rode.\nChuck rode 90 miles, so his total distance is 90 miles + 1.25 miles = 91 miles.\n\nStep 5: Calculate Chuck's speed when he rode out.\nChuck rode 28.8 miles into the country, so his speed is 28.8 miles / 28.8 miles = 1.25 mph.\n\nStep 6: Calculate Chuck's speed when he rode out.\nChuck rode 28.8 miles into the country, so his speed is 28.8 miles / 28.8 miles = 1.25 mph.\n\nFinal answer: Chuck rode out at 1.25 mph.",

      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. First, we need to find Chuck's speed at the start. We know that he rode out at a certain rate of 3 hours and returned at the same rate of 24 mph. So, we can set up an equation:\n\n3h - 24 = 24\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\n3h = 22\n\nDivide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\nh = 8\n\nThis means that Chuck's speed at the start was 8 miles per hour.\n\nNext, let's find Chuck's speed at the end of the trip. We know that he rode out at a certain rate of 28.8 miles and returned at the same rate of 24 mph. So, we can set up an equation:\n\n28.8 = 24 - 28.8\n\nSubtract 28.8 from both sides:\n\n28.8 = 24\n\nDivide both sides by 24:\n\nd = 4\n\nThis means that Chuck's speed at the end of the trip was 4 miles per hour.\n\nFinally, let's put our final answer in \\boxed{}. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n28.8 = 24 + 4\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n28.8 = 6\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\nd = 1\n\nThis means that Chuck's speed at the end of the trip was 1 mile per hour.\n\nSo, Chuck's speed at the start was 8 miles per hour, and his speed at the end of the trip was 1 mile per hour.",
      "To solve this problem, we'll follow the steps outlined in the problem, and then use the information to find Chuck's speed.\n\nFirst, let's convert the distance from the trip into miles. Chuck rode 3 hours, and he rode 28.8 miles. So, the distance from 3 to 28.8 miles is 28.8 miles / 3 hours = 9.6 miles.\n\nNext, we need to convert the speed from miles to feet per hour (mph). The speed is 28.8 mph, and the distance from 3 to 28.8 miles is 28.8 miles / 9.6 miles per hour = 3.33 feet per hour.\n\nNow, we can find Chuck's speed by dividing the distance by the speed: 9.6 miles / 3.33 feet per hour = 3.07 miles per hour.\n\nTo convert this to feet per hour (ft/h), we divide the distance by the speed: 3.07 miles / 3.07 feet per hour = 1.07 feet per hour.\n\nFinally, we can find Chuck's speed when he rode out at a certain rate: 28.8 miles / 1.07 feet per hour = 28.8 miles per hour.\n\nSo, Chuck rode out at a speed of 28.8 miles per hour.",
      "To find Chuck's speed when he rode out, we need to find the speed at which he returned to the starting point. \n\nWe know that Chuck rode 28.8 miles into the country and returned at a rate of 24 mph. This means that he rode for 28.8 / 24 = 1.1 miles per hour.\n\nTo convert this to a fraction, we can multiply by 1000 (since 1 mile is 1,000 meters). So, 1.1 miles per hour * 1,000 = 11 miles per hour.\n\nNow, we need to find his speed when he rode out. Since he rode 1.1 miles per hour, we can find his speed by dividing his distance (1.1 miles) by his speed (11 miles per hour). \n\nSpeed = Distance / Time = 1.1 miles / 1.1 hours = 1.1 miles per hour.\n\nSo, Chuck's speed when he rode out was 1.1 miles per hour.",

Chuck rode 28.8 miles, so the distance he traveled is 28.8 miles / 3 hours = 9.2 miles.\n\nNext, we need to find the time he rode out. Chuck rode out at a rate of 24 mph, so the time he rode out is 24 mph / 3 hours = 9.2 hours.\n\nNow, we need to find the distance he traveled when he rode out.

      "To solve this problem, we can use the properties of divisibility by 8, 11, and 24.\n\nLet's start by understanding what we need to find. We want to find the smallest number that is divisible by 8, 11, and 24.\n\nFirst, we can express the numbers as a sum of their prime factors. Since the prime factors are 8, 11, and 24, we can write the numbers as:\n\n- 8 = 2^2 * 3\n- 11 = 3^2 * 5\n- 24 = 5^2 * 7\n\nNow, we can add these numbers together:\n\n(2^2 * 3) + (3^2 * 5) + (5^2 * 7) = 8 + 3 + 30 = 78\n\nThis means that the smallest number that is divisible by 8, 11, and 24 is 78.\n\nNext, we need to find the largest number that is divisible by 8, 11, and 24.\n\nWe can write the numbers as:\n\n- 8 = 2^2 * 3\n- 11 = 3^2 * 5\n- 24 = 5^2 * 7\n\nNow, we can find the largest number that is divisible by 8, 11, and 24:\n\n- 8 = 2^2 * 3\n- 11 = 3^2 * 5\n- 24 = 5^2 * 7\n\nFinally, we can find the smallest number that is divisible by 8, 11, and 24 by taking the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these numbers:\n\n- GCD(8, 11, 24) = 1\n- GCD(8, 11, 24) = 1\n\nSince the GCD is 1, the smallest number that is divisible by 8, 11, and 24 is 1.\n\nSo, the smallest number that is divisible by 8, 11, and 24 is 1.",
      "To find the smallest number that is divisible by 8, 11, and 24, we first need to identify the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. LCM(8, 11, 24) = 280.\n\nNow, we can calculate the LCM by dividing 280 by the numbers in ascending order:\n\n(280 \u00f7 8) \u00f7 (280 \u00f7 11) \u00f7 (280 \u00f7 24) = (120 \u00f7 8) \u00f7 (16 \u00f7 12) = 12 \u00f7 6 = 2.\n\nSince the LCM is 2, we can conclude that the smallest number that is divisible by 8, 11, and 24 is 255.",

Since 8 is one less than a multiple of 10, we have 8 * 10 = 80 multiples of 8.\n\nNext, let's find the multiples of 11.

Since 24 is one less than a multiple of 14, we have 24 * 14 = 320 multiples of 24.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest number that is divisible by 8, 11, and 24. To do this, we can find the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the multiples of 8, 11, and 24.\n\nFirst, we find the multiples of 11: 11 * 10 = 111 multiple of 11, which is 111 * 10 = 1110.\n\nNext, we find the multiples of 24: 24 * 10 = 240 multiple of 10, which is 240 * 10 = 2400.\n\nFinally, we find the smallest number that is a multiple of 8, 11, and 24.

Since Lucky Lacy missed $x$ of the problems, the total number of problems is the sum of the problems she missed and the problems she did correctly. The total number of problems is $5x$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of problems that Lucky Lacy got correct. We know that Lucky Lacy missed $x$ problems. So, the number of problems she got correct is the sum of the problems she missed and the problems she got correct. This is $5x - x$.\n\nWe can write this as: $5x - x = 5x - x + 1$. Simplifying the equation, we get: $x(5x - 1)$ becomes $x(5x) - 1$.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of problems that Lucky Lacy missed. We know that Lucky Lacy missed $x$ problems. So, the total number of problems that Lucky Lacy missed is $5x - x$.\n\nTo find the percentage of problems that Lucky Lacy got correct, we can divide the total number of problems that Lucky Lacy got correct by the total number of problems that Lucky Lacy missed and multiply by 100. \n\n$5x - x = 5(x) - 1 = 5x - 1$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $x$, we get: $5x = 5x - 1$\n\nDividing both sides by $x$, we get: $x = 5/1$\n\nNow, we can find the percentage of problems that Lucky Lacy got correct by dividing the number of problems that Lucky Lacy got correct by the total number of problems that Lucky Lacy missed.

We want to find out how many problems she got correct.\n\nLet's start by understanding the given information. We know that Lucky Lacy missed $x$ of the $5x$ problems. So, we can write the equation as $5x = x$ since we're dealing with a linear relationship.\n\nNow, let's find the value of $x$. We know that Lucky Lacy missed $x$ of the $5x$ problems, which means she missed $x/5$ of the $5x$ problems. \n\nTo find the value of $x$, we can use the equation $5x = x$.

Since the carpet is square, its side length is also 10 m. The area of a square with side length s is s^2 = s * s = s^2 = s^2, so the area of the square carpet is s^2.\n\nNow, we can find the width of the floor by dividing the area of the carpet by the area of the rectangle.

The area of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length by itself. So, the area of the square carpet is 16 square meters.\n\nNow, we can multiply the area of the carpet by the area of the uncovered area: 16 square meters * 16 square meters = 252 square meters.\n\nFinally, we can add the area of the carpet and the uncovered area to find the total area of the floor.

So, the length of the rectangle is 10 m.\n\nThe area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the side length. In this case, s = 10 m.\n\nNow, we can calculate the area of the rectangle:\nArea of the rectangle = 10 m^2 = 10 * 10 m^2 = 1000 m^2\n\nThe area of the square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the side length.

      "To solve this problem, we first need to find the perimeter of the square. The perimeter of a square is the sum of all the side lengths of the square. The perimeter of a square is 4 times its side length.

The length of the rectangle is 36 centimeters. To find the length of each part, we divide the length of the square (252 centimeters) by 4.

Since the time saved by using a calculator is 60 minutes, and the total time taken is 20 minutes, we can find the time it takes to complete the assignments by dividing the total time by the time saved.\n\nTime to complete the assignments = Total time - Time saved\nTime to complete the assignments = 20 minutes - 60 minutes\nTime to complete the assignments = 10 minutes\n\nSo, it takes Matt 10 minutes to complete the assignments without a calculator.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes to do the problem without a calculator. Since Matt has 2 minutes per problem with a calculator, and 60 minutes is the total time, we can calculate the time it takes to do 20 problems without a calculator as follows:\n\nTime to do 20 problems without a calculator = 2 minutes per problem * 20 problems = 40 minutes\n\nNow, let's calculate the time it takes to do 1 problem with a calculator:\nTime to do 1 problem with a calculator = 2 minutes per problem * 1 problem = 2 minutes\n\nSince 60 minutes is the total time, and 2 minutes is the time it takes to do 1 problem with a calculator, we can find the time it takes to do 2 problems with a calculator by dividing the time it takes to do 1 problem with a calculator by the time it takes to do 2 problems with a calculator:\nTime to do 2 problems with a calculator = 2 minutes per problem * 2 problems = 4 minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes Matt 40 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. Let's start by calculating the total time it takes Matt to do the math homework with a calculator and without a calculator.\n\nSince Matt has 2 minutes per problem, we can multiply the total time by 2. This gives us 2 * 20 = 40 minutes.\n\nNow, let's consider the time it takes Matt to do the math homework without a calculator. If Matt uses a calculator, it will take him 60 minutes. If he uses a calculator without a calculator, it will take him 60 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.\n\nTo find out how many minutes it takes Matt to do the math homework without a calculator, we can divide the total time by the time it takes to do the math homework with a calculator. 120 minutes divided by 60 minutes per problem is 2.4 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it takes Matt 2 minutes to do the math homework without a calculator."
