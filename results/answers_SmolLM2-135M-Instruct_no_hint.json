      "To find the bases of the original trapezoid, let's first identify the bases of the given right trapezoid. The bases of the trapezoid are the two lateral sides that make up the base of the trapezoid. Since the bases are equal to the lateral sides of the trapezoid, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: $\\frac{1}{2}ab$.\n\nNow, let's find the bases of the given right trapezoid. The base of the trapezoid is the diagonal of the base of the trapezoid, which is $\\frac{c}{2}$. The base of the trapezoid is the perpendicular from the midpoint of the base to the base of the trapezoid, which is $\\frac{c}{2}$.\n\nSince the bases of the trapezoid are equal to the lateral sides of the trapezoid, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: $\\frac{1}{2}ab = \\frac{1}{2}c \\cdot \\frac{c}{2} = \\frac{c}{2}$.\n\nNow, we can find the bases of the given right trapezoid by taking the area of the base of the trapezoid, which is $\\frac{c}{2}$, and multiplying it by $\\frac{c}{2}$. Therefore, the bases of the given right trapezoid are $\\frac{c}{2}$ and $\\frac{c}{2}$.\n\nFinally, we can find the bases of the original trapezoid by taking the area of the base of the original trapezoid, which is $\\frac{c}{2}$. Therefore, the bases of the original trapezoid are $\\frac{c}{2}$ and $\\frac{c}{2}$.\n\nSo, the bases of the original trapezoid are $\\frac{c}{2}$ and $\\frac{c}{2}$.",
      "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the bases of the given right trapezoid. The given trapezoid has bases $c$ and $d$, where $c<d$. We can see that the bases of the trapezoid are related to the bases of the right triangles formed by the legs of the trapezoid.\n\nThe trapezoid has three equal bases, each of which can be divided into two equal segments. One of these segments is equal to the length of the base of the trapezoid, which is $c$. The other segment is equal to the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the two legs of the trapezoid. This is because the base of the trapezoid is itself a right triangle, and the length of the base of the trapezoid is equal to the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nTherefore, the base of the trapezoid is $c+d$. We can see that this is equal to the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the two legs of the trapezoid.\n\nTo find the bases of the original right trapezoid, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, the hypotenuse of the right triangle is $c+d$, so the length of the other two sides is $c+d$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the lengths of the bases of the trapezoid.\n\nLet's use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the bases of the original right trapezoid. We can set up an equation for the base of the trapezoid:\n\n$c^2+d^2=c^2+d^2$\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\n$c^2+d^2=c^2+d^2+c^2+d^2$\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the lengths of the bases:\n\n$c^2+d^2=c^2+d^2+c^2+d^2$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$c^2+d^2=c^2+d^2+c^2$\n\nNow, we can equate the two expressions for $c^2$:\n\n$c^2+d^2=c^2+d^2$\n\nSubtracting the two expressions for $c^2$ from each other, we get:\n\n$c^2+d^2=c^2+d^2-c^2$\n\nDividing both sides by $c^2$, we get:\n\n$d^2=c^2$\n\nDividing both sides by $d^2$, we get:\n\n$d^2=c^2-c^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$d=c/c$\n\nThis means that the length of the base of the original right trapezoid is $c/c$.",

      "Step 1: Determine the total time taken by Castel and Ryan to dig the hole together.\nTo do this, we need to add the time it takes Castel to dig the hole and Ryan to dig the hole.\n\nTotal time taken by Castel and Ryan together: 10 ft x 10 ft = 100 ft x 6 = 600 hours\n\nStep 2: Determine the time it takes for Castel and Ryan to dig the hole alone.\nSince Castel digs the hole in 6 hours and Ryan digs the hole in 2.72727272727 hours, we can find the time it takes for Castel and Ryan to dig the hole alone by dividing the total time taken by Castel and Ryan by the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole.\n\nTime taken for Castel to dig the hole alone: 600 hours / 6 hours = 120 hours\n\nStep 3: Determine the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone.\nSince Ryan digs the hole in 2.72727272727 hours, we can find the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone by dividing the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole by the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole.\n\nTime taken for Ryan to dig the hole alone: 2.72727272727 hours / 6 hours = 4.5 hours\n\nStep 4: Add the time it takes for Castel and Ryan to dig the hole together and Ryan to dig the hole alone.\nTo add the time it takes for Castel and Ryan to dig the hole together and Ryan to dig the hole alone, we add the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole to the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone.\n\nTime taken for Castel to dig the hole together: 120 hours + 4.5 hours = 145 hours\n\nStep 5: Determine the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone.\nSince Ryan digs the hole in 2.72727272727 hours, we can find the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone by dividing the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole by the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole.\n\nTime taken for Ryan to dig the hole alone: 2.72727272727 hours / 6 hours = 4.5 hours\n\nStep 6: Determine the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole alone and Ryan to dig the hole alone.\nTo add the time it takes for Castel and Ryan to dig the hole together and Ryan to dig the hole alone, we add the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole to the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone.\n\nTime taken for Castel to dig the hole alone: 145 hours + 4.5 hours = 150 hours\n\nStep 7: Determine the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone and Castel to dig the hole together.\nTo add the time it takes for Castel and Ryan to dig the hole together and Ryan to dig the hole alone, we add the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole to the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone.\n\nTime taken for Castel to dig the hole alone: 145 hours + 4.5 hours = 150 hours\n\nStep 8: Determine the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone and Castel to dig the hole together and Castel to dig the hole together.\nTo add the time it takes for Castel and Ryan to dig the hole together and Ryan to dig the hole alone, we add the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole to the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone.\n\nTime taken for Castel to dig the hole alone: 150 hours + 4.5 hours = 165 hours\n\nStep 9: Determine the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone and Castel to dig the hole together and Castel to dig the hole together.\nTo add the time it takes for Castel and Ryan to dig the hole together and Ryan to dig the hole alone, we add the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole to the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone.\n\nTime taken for Castel to dig the hole alone: 165 hours + 4.5 hours = 170 hours\n\nStep 10: Determine the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone and",
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Ryan can dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole in 10 hours. This means that if they work together, it would take them 10 * 10 = 100 hours to dig the hole alone.\n\nOn the other hand, Castel can dig the same hole in 6 hours. This means that if they work together, it would take them 6 * 6 = 36 hours to dig the hole alone.\n\nTo find out how many hours it takes for both of them to dig the hole alone, we need to subtract the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole from the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole.\n\nLet's calculate the time it takes for each of them to dig the hole alone:\n\n- Ryan: 10 hours\n- Castel: 36 hours\n\nSince they work together, the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole alone is the difference between the time it takes for Ryan and Castel to dig the hole: 36 - 10 = 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, it takes Castel 24 hours to dig the hole alone.",
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Castel can dig the hole in 6 hours. So, if we subtract the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole from the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole, we get:\n\n10 ft - 6 ft = 4 ft\n\nSince it takes 2.72727272727 hours to dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole, we can calculate the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole alone:\n\n2.72727272727 hours / 4 ft = 6.3333333333 hours\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it takes for Castel to dig the hole alone.

Therefore, the value of m is -1.\n\nThe coefficient of the x^2 term is 1, and the highest power of x is 2.\n\nTo find the value of m, we use the formula:\n\nm = -1 + (2\u221a2)\n\nm = -1 + 2\u221a2\n\nm = -1 + 4\u221a2\n\nm = -1 + 8\u221a2\n\nTherefore, the value of m is -1 + 8\u221a2.\n\nThe quadratic function y = -x^2 + 2x + m^2 has a maximum value of -1 + 8\u221a2.\n\nTo express this in the form \u00b1\u221avalue, we can rewrite the function as y = -x^2 + 2x + 8\u221a2, which is equivalent to y = -x^2 + 2x + 8.\n\nSo, the value of m is -1 + 8\u221a2.\n\nFinal answer: m = -1 + 8\u221a2.",
      "To find the value of m, we need to analyze the given quadratic function y = -x^2 + 2x + m^2 and find its maximum value.\n\nWe can start by completing the square on the left-hand side of the equation, which gives us y = -(x^2 + 2x) + 2x + m^2. This can be rewritten as y = -(x^2 + 2x) + 2m + m^2.\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for y from the left-hand side into the right-hand side: y = -(x^2 + 2x) + 2m + m^2.\n\nSince the right-hand side is a perfect square, it will be a perfect square trinomial. Let's call this expression x^2 + 2x + 1. We can rewrite the right-hand side as x^2 + 2x + 2 + 1 = x^2 + 2x + 1 + 1 = x^2 + 2x + 2 + 1.\n\nNow, we can complete the square on the right-hand side of the equation: y = -x^2 + 2x + 1 + 1 = -x^2 + 2x + 1 + 1.\n\nNext, we can factor the quadratic expression x^2 + 2x + 1 as (x + 1)^2. This gives us the complete square expression: y = -x^2 + 2x + 1 + 1 + 1 = -x^2 + 2x + 1 + 1 + 1.\n\nNow, we can add and subtract the two expressions: y = -x^2 + 2x + 1 + 1 + 1 - (-x^2 + 2x + 1) = -x^2 + 2x + 1 - 1 = -x^2 + 2x + 1.\n\nFinally, we can multiply the entire expression by -1: y = -x^2 + 2x + 1.\n\nNow, we can find the value of m by substituting y = -x^2 + 2x + 1 into the function: m = -x^2 + 2x + 1 + 1 = -x^2 + 2x + 1 + 1.\n\nTherefore, the value of m is -x^2 + 2x + 1.",

      "To find the minimum value of $\\overset{\u2192}{PA} \\cdot \\overset{\u2192}{PB}$, we first need to find the area of triangle $ABC$. This is a classic problem in geometry, and we can use Heron's formula to find the area.\n\nHeron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides of length $a$, $b$, and $c$, is given by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}}$. In this case, $a=3$, $b=4$, $c=5$, $s=3$, $s-a=4$, $s-b=5$, $s-c=6$. We are given that the triangle has sides of length $3, 4, 5$, and $5$, and we want to find the minimum value of $\\overset{\u2192}{PA} \\cdot \\overset{\u2192}{PB}$.\n\nUsing Heron's formula, we get $\\overset{\u2192}{PA} \\cdot \\overset{\u2192}{PB} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3(3-4)(5-5)(6-6)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{24(24-36)(24-6)(24-1)}}. \\label{eq:A_1}\n\nNow we need to find the area of triangle $ABC$. To do this, we can use Heron's formula again, but this time we will use the fact that $\\overset{\u2192}{PA} \\cdot \\overset{\u2192}{PB}$ is a right triangle. We can find the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, which gives us $\\overline{BC} = \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow that we have the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle, we can use Heron's formula again to find the area of triangle $ABC$. We will use the fact that $\\overline{BC} = \\sqrt{3}$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{BC} &= \\sqrt{3}(3-4)(5-5)(6-6) \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{3}(2)(1)(1) \\\\\n&= 2. \\end{align*}\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overset{\u2192}{PA} \\cdot \\overset{\u2192}{PB} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(2)^2(1)^2}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}. \\end{align*}\n\nFinally, we can plug in the values of the sides of triangle $ABC$ into Heron's formula to find the minimum value of $\\overset{\u2192}{PA} \\cdot \\overset{\u2192}{PB}$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overset{\u2192}{PA} \\cdot \\overset{\u2192}{PB} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(2)^2(1)^2}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(4)(1)(1)}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}. \\end{align*}\n\nSo, the minimum value of $\\overset{\u2192}{PA} \\cdot \\overset{\u2192}{PB}$ is $\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\overline{BC} = 2.$",

This is equivalent to $\\left(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}\\right)^{2} \\geq n\\left(x^{4} + y^{4} + z^{4}\\right)$. \n\nNow, we can substitute $x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = x + y + z$, which gives us $n(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) = n(x + y + z)$. \n\nSince we have already factored the right-hand side as $x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = (x + y + z)(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2})$, we can substitute this into the inequality. \n\nThis gives us $n(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) \\geq n(x + y + z)$.\n\nHowever, we are trying to minimize the absolute value of the expression for $n$ and we know that $n(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) = n(x + y + z)$. \n\nThe maximum absolute value of the expression for $n$ is $n(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) = n(x + y + z)$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that $n(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) = n(x + y + z)$, which gives us $n(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) \\geq n(x + y + z)$.\n\nHowever, we are trying to minimize the absolute value of the expression for $n$ and we know that $n(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) = n(x + y + z)$, which gives us $n(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) \\geq n(x + y + z)$.\n\nSince $n(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) \\geq n(x + y + z)$, we can equate the two inequalities to get $n(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) \\geq n(x + y + z)$.\n\nHowever, we are trying to minimize the absolute value of the expression for $n$ and we know that $n(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) = n(x + y + z)$, which gives us $n(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) \\geq n(x + y + z)$.\n\nSince $n(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) \\geq n(x + y + z)$, we can equate the two inequalities to get $n(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) \\geq n(x + y + z)$.\n\nHowever, we are trying to minimize the absolute value of the expression for $n$ and we know that $n"

      "Let's start by analyzing the given information.

Since $a=9$, $b=10$, and $c=12$, we can write:\n\n$a+b+c=9+10+12=13$\n\nNow, we can see that $c$ is equal to $12$. This means that $c$ is not equal to $12$.\n\nTherefore, the shape of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_$, which is the sum of the lengths of the three sides.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n$\\triangle ABC$ is $\\triangle 1$",
      "I'll break down the problem step by step to help you understand the reasoning step by step.\n\n1. Let's denote the lengths of the sides of the triangle as $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n2. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n3. Since the lengths of $a$, $b$, and $c$ are equal, we can set up the inequality $a + b + c > 9$.\n4. Since $c = 12$, we can substitute this value into the inequality.\n5. So, the inequality becomes $a + b + c > 9$.\n6. Now, let's examine the possible values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n7. $a$ is greater than $b$ and $c$, so $a > 9$.\n8. $b$ is greater than $c$, so $b > 9$.\n9. $c$ is less than $a$, so $c < 9$.\n10. Since $c$ is less than $a$, we can conclude that $c < 9$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the expression $c < 9$.\n\n$c < 9$ = $9 - 9$ = 0\n\nSo, the shape of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_$.\n\nI'll be happy to explain the reasoning step by step and provide the final answer.",

This is a common technique for solving equations with integers.\n\nWe start by adding 1 to both sides of the equation, resulting in 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0. This simplifies to 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0, which can be further factored as (2^x - 1)(2^x + 1) = 0.\n\nNow, we can factor the left-hand side using the difference of squares formula: (2^x - 1)(2^x + 1) = 0.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2.8 kg + 1 meter = 3 meters.\n\nFinally, we can find the weight of the bag by subtracting 1 meter from 3 meters: 3 meters - 1 meter = 2 meters. Therefore, the total weight of the bag and chair is 2 meters.",
      "1. The bag and chair are cut into 2 meters and 2.8 kg, respectively.\n2. The sum of their weights is 29/8 + 2.8 = 4.5 kilograms.\n3. Since the bag and chair are cut into 2 meters and 2.8 kg, we can simply add these 2 kilograms to the sum of their weights.\n4. The total weight of the bag and chair is 2 + 4.5 = 6.5 kilograms.\n5. Therefore, the total weight of the bag and chair is 6.5 kilograms.\n6. So, the answer is 6.5 kilograms."

We know that the tiger is chasing its prey at a constant speed, and its body passes a blade of grass in 1 second.\n\nWe can calculate the time it takes for the tiger to cover the length of the blade of grass in 1 second. This is because the tiger has to cover 1 second for the grass to be broken, and since the grass is 1 meter long, the tiger will cover 1 meter in 1 second.\n\nIn this case, the tiger needs to cover 1 meter in 1 second. So, we can calculate the time it takes for the tiger to cover this distance: 1 meter / 1 second = 1 second.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total time it takes for the tiger to cover the length of the blade of grass in 1 second by multiplying the length of the blade of grass (5 meters) by the time it takes for the tiger to cover it (1 second): 5 meters * 1 second = 5 meters.\n\nFinally, we can find the total length of the blade of grass in 1 second by adding the length of the tiger and the length of the blade of grass: 5 meters + 5 meters = 10 meters.\n\nSo, the length of the fallen tree trunk is 10 meters.",

The tiger is chasing its prey at a constant speed of 5 meters per second, and the length of its body is 5 meters.\n\nThe falling tree trunk is 5 meters above the ground, and the length of the tiger is 5 meters. The tiger is moving at 5 meters per second.\n\nLet's denote the time it takes the tiger to reach the fallen tree trunk as t. Since the tiger is moving at a constant speed of 5 meters per second, its distance from the ground is 5 meters.\n\nThe time it takes the tiger to reach the fallen tree trunk is t/5 + 1, because the tiger is moving at 5 meters per second and it needs to cover 5 meters to reach the fallen trunk.\n\nThe time it takes the tiger to cover the 5 meters is t/5 + 1 = 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 seconds.\n\nNow, we can find the length of the fallen tree trunk by dividing 5 meters by 1.5 seconds.\n\nThe length of the fallen tree trunk is 5 meters / 2.5 seconds = 2.1 meters.\n\nSo, the fallen tree trunk is 2.1 meters long.\n\nThe answer is: 2.1",
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. The key to this problem is understanding the relationship between the speed of the tiger, the speed of the falling tree trunk, and the time taken to cover the remaining distance.\n\nThe speed of the tiger is the speed of the grass in meters per second. Since the grass is moving at 1 meter per second, the speed of the falling tree trunk is 1 meter per second.\n\nThe time taken for the tiger to cover the remaining distance is the time it takes for the grass to cover the remaining distance. This is the distance covered by the grass in 5 seconds. Since the grass covers 5 meters in 1 second, it takes 5 seconds for the grass to cover 5 meters.\n\nNow, let's calculate the speed of the falling tree trunk. The speed of the fallen tree trunk is 1 meter per second. Since the grass covers 5 meters in 1 second, it takes 5 seconds for the fallen tree trunk to cover 5 meters.\n\nThe speed of the falling tree trunk is 5 meters per second. Therefore, the time it takes for the falling tree trunk to cover the remaining distance is 5 seconds.\n\nSo, the answer is 5 seconds.",

The time it takes for the tiger to run above the fallen tree trunk is 25 seconds * 5 = 125 seconds.\n6. The total time the tiger spends running above the fallen tree trunk is 125 seconds + 125 seconds = 240 seconds.\n7. The total distance the tiger covers is 5 meters + 5 meters = 10 meters.\n8. The total time it takes for the tiger to cover 10 meters is 10 meters / 240 seconds = 0.017 seconds.\n\nSo, the answer is 0.017 seconds.\n\nTo put this into \\boxed{} format:\n\n\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}}\n\\text{Time taken for the tiger to run above the fallen tree trunk} & =& 0.017 seconds \\\\\n\\text{Time taken for the tiger to run above the fallen tree trunk} & =& 125 seconds \\\\\n\\text{Total time the tiger covers} & =& 10 meters \\\\\n\\text{Total distance the tiger covers} & =& 10 meters \\\\\n\\text{Total time it takes for the tiger to cover 10 meters} & =& 240 seconds \\\\\n\\text{Total time it takes for the tiger to cover 240 seconds} & =& 240 seconds \\\\\n\\text{Total time it takes for the tiger to cover 240 seconds} & =& 240 seconds + 240 seconds =& 480 seconds.\n\\end{array}",

However, this path is not always a straight line. It will eventually intersect with the fallen tree trunk.\n\nLet's first find the distance between the tiger's path and the fallen tree trunk. The distance between the tiger's path and the fallen tree trunk is equal to the difference in the distance between the two points.

We can rewrite $g(x)$ as $g(1) = \\frac{1}{2}g(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2)$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that $g(x)$ maps $y$ to $x$ in the interval $[1, 2]$ to find the range of $y$. Let $f(x) = \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}}x$. Then $f(1) = \\frac{1}{2}f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2) = \\frac{1}{2}(1^2) = 1$.\n\nSo, the range of $y = g(x)$ on the interval $[1, 2]$ is $1$.",
      "To find the range of the function $y = g(x)$ on the interval $[1, 2]$, we need to consider the behavior of $g(x)$ as $x$ varies over this interval.\n\nFirst, we note that the logarithm function $log_{\\frac{1}{2}}x$ has a continuous, positive derivative at $x = 1$. Therefore, we can use the chain rule to find the derivative of $g(x)$:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{ccc} \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{g(1)}{g(x)} & = & \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{g(x)}{g(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = 1 \\\\ \\end{array}$$\n\nNext, we notice that $g(1) = 1$ since $g(x) = x$. Thus, we can apply the chain rule again to find the derivative of $g(x)$:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{ccc} \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{g(1)}{g(x)} & = & \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{g(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = 1 \\\\ \\end{array}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute $g(1) = 1$ into the original function $y = g(x)$, which gives us:\n\n$$y = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = 1$$\n\nTherefore, the range of the function $y = g(x)$ on the interval $[1, 2]$ is $[1, 1]$.",

Since $x$ is a positive number, the logarithm of $x$ is $1/x$. \n\nNow, let's consider the logarithm of $x$ on the interval $[1, 2]$. The logarithm of $x$ on the interval $[1, 2]$ is $1/2$.\n\nNext, we need to find the logarithm of $y$ on the interval $[1, 2]$.

Now, we need to find the inverse of this function.\n\nThe inverse of a function is defined as the function that \"reverses\" the input. In this case, the inverse is simply the original function $f(x) = x + \\frac{1}{2}x$.\n\nNow, let's apply the inverse function to the interval $[1, 2]$.\n\nWe start by setting $x = 1$ in the original function:\n\n$f(1) = \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}}(1 + \\frac{1}{2}x) = \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}}(1 + \\frac{1}{2}x) = \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{2}x = \\frac{1}{2}x + 1$\n\nSo, the inverse of $f(x)$ is $\\frac{1}{2}x + 1$.\n\nNow, we need to find the range of the function $y = g(x)$.\n\nSince $g(x) = x + \\frac{1}{2}x$, we can rewrite the function as:\n\n$g(x) = x + \\frac{1}{2}x = \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{2}x = \\frac{1}{2}x + 1$\n\nSo, the range of the function $y = g(x)$ is $x + 1$.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function $y = g(x)$ on the interval $[1, 2]$ is $x + 1$."

      "To find the value of a \u2208 (0, \u03c0) such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) always holds true, we can use the sine function. The sine function has a maximum value of 1 at \u03c0/2 and a minimum value of -1 at -\u03c0/2.\n\nWe want to find a value of a that satisfies the equation f(x+a) = f(x+3a) for all values of x greater than or equal to a. This can be rewritten as f(x+a) = f(x) - 3a.\n\nSubstituting f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) into this equation, we get f(x+a) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) - 3a. Since sin(2x - \u03c0/4) = 0, we can rewrite sin(2x - \u03c0/4) as 1/2.\n\nNow we can substitute this into f(x+a) = f(x) - 3a, giving us f(x+a) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) - 3a = 1/2 - 3a.\n\nThe key insight here is that the sine function is symmetric about the line y = x. Since sin(2x - \u03c0/4) = 0, we can conclude that sin(2x - \u03c0/4) = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find a value of x that satisfies sin(2x - \u03c0/4) = 0.

      "Step 1: Determine the equation of the original parabola\n\nThe equation of the original parabola is $y = -2x^{2}$.\n\nStep 2: Shift down $1$ unit and right $3$ units\n\nTo shift down $1$ unit, we need to subtract $-2$ from $y$. So, $y = -2(1)^{2} = -2$.\n\nTo shift right $3$ units, we need to add $-2$ to $y$. So, $y = -2(3)^{2} = -8$.\n\nStep 3: Combine the shifted and right sides\n\nThe combined equation is $y = -2(3)^{2}$.\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation\n\nTo simplify the equation, we need to get rid of the negative sign.\n\n$y = -2(3)^{2}$ simplifies to $y = -8$.\n\nStep 5: Add the two equations\n\nWe add the two equations to get the final equation:\n\n$y = -2(3)^{2} + (-8) = -8 + 8 = -4$\n\nSo, the analytical expression of the parabola $y=-2x^{2}$ after shifting down $1$ unit and right $3$ units is -4.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation $y=-2x^{2}$, where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the parabola.\n\nFirst, we need to find the coordinates of the vertex of the parabola. The vertex is the point of minimum or maximum value of the function. Let's find the coordinates of the vertex:\n\n$y = -2(1)^2 = -2$\n\nSo, the vertex is at the point $(1, -2)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the coordinates of the axis of symmetry. The axis of symmetry is the line that passes through the vertex of the parabola and divides the parabola into two halves. In this case, the axis of symmetry is the line that passes through the point $(1, -2)$.\n\nSo, the axis of symmetry is also $(1, -2)$.\n\nNext, we need to find the coordinates of the focus of the parabola. The focus is the point where the parabola intersects the x-axis. The focus is the point where the parabola is perpendicular to the x-axis. The focus is $(1, 2)$.\n\nFinally, we need to find the coordinates of the directrix of the parabola. The directrix is the line that passes through the vertex of the parabola and is perpendicular to the parabola. The directrix is the line that is parallel to the axis of symmetry. The directrix is the line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry. The directrix is the line that is parallel to the axis of symmetry.\n\nSo, the directrix is the line that is parallel to the axis of symmetry. The directrix is the line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry.\n\nNow, we can find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation $y=-2x^{2}$:\n\n$x = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$y = -2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = -2$\n\nSo, the coordinates of the vertex are $(1, -2)$, the axis of symmetry is $(1, -2)$, the focus is $(1, 2)$, and the directrix is the line that is parallel to the axis of symmetry.\n\nFinally, the value of $x$ is $1$, the value of $y$ is -2, and the value of $x$ and $y$ is $(1, -2)$.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n$x = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$, $y = -2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = -2$, and $x = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.",
      "The analytical expression of the parabola $y=-2x^{2}$ after shifting down $1$ units and then shifting right $3$ units is:\n\n$$y=-2\\left(1-3\\right)x^{2}$$\n\nTo shift down $1$ units, we need to divide by $2$, so the new expression becomes:\n\n$$y=-2\\left(1-3\\right)x^{2}$$\n\nTo shift right $3$ units, we need to divide by $3$, so the new expression becomes:\n\n$$y=-2\\left(1-3\\right)x^{2}$$\n\nSo, the final expression of the parabola after shifting down $1$ units and then right $3$ units is:\n\n$$y=-2\\left(1-3\\right)x^{2}$$\n\nTherefore, the analytical expression of the parabola $y=-2x^{2}$ after shifting down $1$ units and then right $3$ units is $$y=-2\\left(1-3\\right)x^{2}$$",
      "To solve this problem, we need to consider the geometric interpretation of the parabola $y=-2x^{2}$. The parabola represents the set of all possible values that $x$ can take. When we shift down $1$ unit and right $3$ units, we are essentially changing the sign of $x$ by $-1$. This is because $x$ has a negative sign when we are moving $1$ units to the right and a positive sign when we are moving $3$ units to the right.\n\nThe parabola $y=-2x^{2}$ is a quadratic function, and its graph is a parabola that opens upwards. When we shift down $1$ unit and right $3$ units, the parabola becomes a parabola that opens upwards, but shifted upwards by $1$ units. This means that the parabola has a vertical shift of $1$ units to the right and a horizontal shift of $3$ units to the left, resulting in a parabola that is symmetric about its axis of symmetry.\n\nTo find the value of $y$, we can use the fact that the parabola $y=-2x^{2}$ is symmetric about its axis of symmetry. This symmetry is due to the fact that the parabola is a shifted version of the original parabola.\n\nSo, the final answer is: $y=-2x^{2}$.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to find the quadratic function $y$ after shifting down $1$ unit and then shifting right $3$ units.\n\nFirst, let's find the roots of the quadratic function $y=-2x^{2}$. This is done by factoring the quadratic expression:\n\n$y=-2x^{2}$ = (2x)(x^2) + 2x\n\nNow, we can find the roots of the quadratic function using the quadratic formula:\n\n$y = \\frac{-2(x^2)(x)}{2(x)}$\n\nSimplifying the quadratic expression, we get:\n\n$y = \\frac{-2x^{2}}{2}$\n\nNow, let's find the roots of the quadratic function after shifting down $1$ unit and then shifting right $3$ units:\n\n$y=-2x^{2}+2x-3$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we can find the roots:\n\n$y = \\frac{-2(3)(x)}{2(3)}$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$y = \\frac{2}{2}$\n\n$y = 1$\n\nSo, the function $y=-2x^{2}$ after shifting down $1$ unit and then shifting right $3$ units is $1$.\n\n\\boxed{}\n\nFinal answer: $1$."

The distance is 5 kilometers.\n\nNext, we convert this distance to kilometers. To do so, we multiply the distance by the speed of the car: 5 kilometers * 5 kilometers/kilometer = 25 kilometers.\n\nNow, we convert this distance back to kilometers. Since 25 kilometers is equal to 25 * 5 kilometers/kilometer = 125 kilometers, the car travels 125 kilometers to the west.\n\nSo, the car travels 125 kilometers to the west."

      "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The normal distribution has a mean of $80$ and a standard deviation of $10$.\n2. The scores are between 80 and 90.\n3. The total number of students is 48.\n4. The mean score is $80$ and the standard deviation is $10$.\n5. We want to find the number of students who scored between 80 and 90.\n6. We know that the mean score is $80$ and the standard deviation is $10$.\n7. To find the number of students who scored between 80 and 90, we subtract the mean score from the standard deviation.\n8. The number of students who scored between 80 and 90 is the number of students who scored less than $80$ and $90$.\n\nStep 1: Find the mean score and standard deviation\n\nMean score = (80 + 90) / 2 = 170 / 2 = 80\nStandard deviation = $10$ / 2 = $5$\n\nStep 2: Find the number of students who scored between 80 and 90\n\n$80 - 80 = 0$\n$100 - 90 = 10$\n$90 - 10 = 80$\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of students who scored between 80 and 90\n\nNumber of students who scored between 80 and 90 = 80 - 10 = 70\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of students who scored between 80 and 90\n\nNumber of students who scored between 80 and 90 = Number of students who scored between 80 and 90 - 10\n= 70 - 10\n= 60\n\nStep 5: Calculate the number of students who scored between 80 and 90\n\nNumber of students who scored between 80 and 90 = Number of students who scored between 80 and 90 - 10\n= 60 - 10\n= 50\n\nSo, the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 is 60, and the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 is 50.",

      "To determine the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points, we need to calculate the z-score for each score and then use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find the corresponding area under the curve.\n\nThe z-score formula is $z = \\frac{(X - \u03bc)}{\\sigma}$, where $X$ is the score, $\u03bc$ is the mean, and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation.\n\nFor a score of 80, we want to find the area under the curve from $80$ to $90$. The z-score for this score is $80 = (80 - 80) / 100 = 0$.\n\nFor a score of 90, we want to find the area under the curve from $90$ to $100$. The z-score for this score is $90 = (90 - 90) / 100 = 1$.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table), we find that the area to the right of $80$ is approximately 0.3428, and the area to the right of $90$ is approximately 0.6942.\n\nSince the z-score for a score of 80 is 0.3428, and the z-score for a score of 90 is 1.0262, the area to the right of $80$ is approximately 0.3428 + 0.6942 = 0.9458, and the area to the right of $90$ is approximately 0.6942 - 0.3428 = 0.4152.\n\nSince the area to the right of $80$ is 0.3428, and the area to the right of $90$ is 0.6942, the total area under the curve is approximately 0.3428 + 0.6942 = 0.9458.\n\nFinally, we can use the standard normal distribution table to find the corresponding area under the curve. The area to the right of $80$ is 0.3428, and the area to the right of $90$ is 0.6942. The area to the right of $80$ is 0.3428, and the area to the right of $90$ is 0.6942.\n\nThe total area under the curve is 0.3428 + 0.6942 = 0.9458.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points is approximately 0.9458.",

      "To determine the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points, we need to calculate the z-score, which represents the number of standard deviations away from the mean.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean, which is $80 + 100 = 200$.\n\nNext, we calculate the standard deviation, which is $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} (1 - 80)^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{48} (100 - 100^{2})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{48} (100)^{2}} = \\sqrt{100 * 100} = 100.$\n\nNow, we calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the score, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nz = (80 - 100) / 100\nz = 0.00\n\nThis z-score tells us that the score of 80 is 0 standard deviations below the mean.\n\nTo find the number of students who scored between 80 and 90, we subtract the z-score from the mean:\n\nNumber of students who scored between 80 and 90 = Number of students who scored between 80 and 90 - z\n\nNumber of students who scored between 80 and 90 = 48 - 0.00\nNumber of students who scored between 80 and 90 = 48 - 9\nNumber of students who scored between 80 and 90 = 48 - 10\nNumber of students who scored between 80 and 90 = 48 - 11\nNumber of students who scored between 80 and 90 = 38\n\nSo, approximately 38 students scored between 80 and 90 points in the class."

      "To solve this problem, let's first understand the structure of sets and their properties. Sets are collections of unique objects, and they can be thought of as a way to group similar items together.

This means that every integer from 1 to 12 is in set X.\n\nSet Y consists of all integers from 0 to some number, inclusive. This means that every integer from 0 to some number is in set Y.\n\nNow, let's consider the problem. We want to find the ending number of set Y.\n\nTo start, we can think of the integers from 0 to 12 as the group of integers that belong to set X. These integers are the \"starting points\" for set Y. Since set X contains all integers from 1 to 12, the integers from 1 to 12 are the \"ending points\" for set Y.\n\nNow, let's consider the integers from 1 to 12. Since set X contains all integers from 1 to 12, the integers from 1 to 12 are the \"ending points\" for set Y.\n\nHowever, we know that set Y contains all integers from 0 to some number, inclusive. Since set X contains all integers from 1 to 12, the integers from 0 to 12 are the \"ending points\" for set Y.\n\nNow, let's consider the integers from 0 to 12.

The integers from 0 to 12 are the \"ending points\" for set Y, while the integers from 1 to 12 are the \"ending points\" for set X.\n\nHowever, we can still simplify the problem by looking at it from the perspective of the integers from 0 to 12, which are the \"ending points\" for set Y.\n\nSince set X contains all integers from 1 to 12, the integers from 0 to 12 are the \"ending points\" for set Y.\n\nNow, let's consider the integers from 0 to 12.

      "To solve this problem, we first need to find the inverse function of the given function. The inverse function of a function is defined as the function that \"reverses\" its input. In this case, the inverse function of $f(x)=1+\\log_{a}x$ is $f^(-1)(x)=x-1$.\n\nTo find the inverse function, we need to find the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$. We can do this using the power rule of differentiation, which states that if we have a function of the form $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x^n}$, its derivative is $f'(x)=\\frac{1}{x^n}$.\n\nUsing the power rule, we can find the derivative of $f(x)$ using the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a composite function of the form $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x^n}$, its derivative is $f'(x)=\\frac{1}{x^n}|_{x=0}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of the given function $f(x)=1+\\log_{a}x$. We can do this by setting $f(0)=-1$ and solving for $x$.\n\nSubstituting $x=0$ into the equation $f(x)=1+\\log_{a}x$, we get $f(0)=-1$. Solving for $x$ in terms of $a$ gives $x=0$.\n\nTherefore, the inverse function of the given function is $f^(-1)(x)=\\frac{1}{0-1}=\\frac{1}{0}$.",
      "To find the inverse function of the given function $f(x) = 1 + \\log_{a}x$, we need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$ for $x$. This can be done by setting each term in the function equal to zero and solving for $x$.\n\nFirst, we have the equation $f(x) = 0$, which means that $f(x) = 0$ when $x = 0$. This gives us the equation $x = 0$.\n\nNext, we have the equation $f(x) = 1 + \\log_{a}x$, which means that $f(x) = 1 + \\log_{a}x$ when $x = 1$. This gives us the equation $x = 1$.\n\nNow, we can substitute $x = 0$ and $x = 1$ into the equation $f(x) = 1 + \\log_{a}x$ to solve for $x$. This gives us $f(0) = 1 + \\log_{0}x$ and $f(1) = 1 + \\log_{1}x$.\n\nWe can now substitute $x = 1$ and $x = 0$ into these equations to find $f(1) = 1 + \\log_{1}x$ and $f(0) = 1 + \\log_{0}x$.\n\nTherefore, the inverse function of the given function $f(x) = 1 + \\log_{a}x$ is $f^{-1}(x) = \\log_{1}x - \\log_{0}x$.\n\nSo, the inverse function of the given function $f(x) = 1 + \\log_{a}x$ is $f^{-1}(x) = \\log_{1}x - \\log_{0}x$.",
      "Let's start by defining the inverse function of $f(x)$. The inverse function of $f(x)$, denoted as $f^(-1)(x)$, is defined as:\n\n$$f^(-1)(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\log_{a}x & \\text{if } x \\neq 0 \\\\\n1 & \\text{if } x = 0\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the point $(8,4)$ on the graph of $f(x)$. We know that the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f(x)$ at the point $(8,4)$ is $1$. This means that the line of best fit for the graph of $f(x)$ is a straight line with a slope of 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the equation of the line of best fit.

      "To solve this problem, let's break down the information given. We know that Chuck rode 3 hours and 30 miles total, and he returned at a rate of 24 mph. \n\nWe can set up an equation based on this information: \n\n3 hours * 30 miles = 90 miles / 24 mph\n\nNow, we can simplify this equation to: \n\n90 miles / 24 mph = 3 hours * 30 miles / 24 mph\n\nTo find the value of '3 hours', we can divide both sides of the equation by 24 mph:\n\n90 miles / 24 mph / 3 hours = 3 hours * 30 miles / 24 mph / 3 hours\n\nTo simplify this, we can rewrite 3 hours as 3/24 hours, which gives us:\n\n90 miles / 24 mph = 3 hours * 30 miles / 24 mph / 3 hours\n\nNow, we can rewrite this as:\n\n90 miles / 24 mph = (3 hours * 30 miles / 24 mph) / 3 hours\n\nTo simplify this, we can divide both sides by 3:\n\n90 miles / 24 mph = (3 * 30 miles / 24 mph) / 3 hours\n\nTo simplify this further, we can divide both sides by 3:\n\n90 miles / 24 mph = 60 miles / 24 hours\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 24 hours to find the value of '60 miles / 24 hours':\n\n60 miles / 24 hours = (3 * 60 miles / 24 hours) / 3 hours\n\nTo simplify this further, we can divide both sides by 3 hours:\n\n(3 * 60 miles / 24 hours) / 3 hours = (60 * 24) / 3 hours\n\nTo simplify this further, we can divide both sides by 24 hours:\n\n(60 * 24) / 3 hours = (3600) / 3 hours\n\nTo simplify this further, we can divide both sides by 3 hours:\n\n(60 * 3600) / 3 hours = (960000) / 3 hours\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 3 hours to find the value of '960000':\n\n(960000) / 3 hours = (600000) / 3 hours\n\nTo simplify this further, we can divide both sides by 3 hours:\n\n(600000) / 3 hours = (1600000) / 3 hours\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 3 hours:\n\n(600000) / 3 hours = (1600000) / 3 hours\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 3 hours to find the value of '1600000':\n\n(1600000) / 3 hours = (600000) / 3 hours\n\nTo simplify this further, we can divide both sides by 3 hours:\n\n(600000) / 3 hours = (1600000) / 3 hours\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 3 hours to find the value of '1600000':\n\n(1600000) / 3 hours = (360000) / 3 hours\n\nTo simplify this further, we can divide both sides by 3 hours:\n\n(360000) / 3 hours = (1600000) / 3 hours\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 3 hours to find the value of '1600000':\n\n(1600000) / 3 hours = (600000) / 3 hours\n\nTo simplify this further, we can divide both sides by 3 hours:\n\n(600000) / 3 hours = (1600000) / 3 hours\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 3 hours to find the value of '1600000':\n\n(1600000) / 3 hours = (2400000) / 3 hours\n\nTo simplify this",
      "To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Chuck rode 3 hours total and returned at 24 mph, which is a 3-hour trip. We also know that he rode 28.8 miles into the country and returned at the rate of 24 mph.\n\nFirst, let's convert the miles to kilometers (km). Chuck rode 3 hours, so he rode 3 kilometers. Since he returned at 24 mph, he rode 28.8 kilometers.\n\nNow, we need to find his speed. To do this, we need to divide the distance (28.8 km) by the speed (24 mph). The speed is 24 mph, so his speed is 28.8 km / 24 mph.\n\nWe can rewrite this as 28.8 km / 24 mph = 9.4 km / 1.3 mph. To convert this to feet, we divide by 1.3: 9.4 km / 1.3 mph = 6.66 feet / 1.3 mph.\n\nFinally, we can find his speed in feet per minute (ft/min): 6.66 ft/min / 1.3 mph = 4.04 ft/min.\n\nSo, Chuck rode 4.04 feet per minute (ft/min) when he rode out. To convert it back to miles, we multiply by 1.609344 miles per hour (mph): 4.04 ft/min * 1.609344 mph = 7.173666 miles.\n\nSo, Chuck rode out at a speed of 7.17 miles per hour.",
      "To find Chuck's speed when he rode out, we need to find the distance he traveled (28.8 miles) and the time he rode out (28.8 miles / 3 hours).\n\nDistance = Speed * Time\nDistance = 28.8 miles * 2 hours\nDistance = 66.4 miles\n\nNow, we can find his speed by dividing the distance by the time:\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 66.4 miles / 2 hours\nSpeed = 31.2 miles per hour\n\nSo, Chuck rode out at a speed of 31.2 miles per hour.",
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Chuck rode 28.8 miles into the country and returned at the rate of 24 mph. We also know that he rode 3 hours total.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many miles he rode in total. We can do this by adding the miles he rode in the first 28.8 hours and then dividing by the rate of 24 mph.\n\nTotal miles = 28.8 miles\nRate of 24 mph = 24 mph/mile\nTotal miles = 28.8 miles + 24 miles = 52 miles\n\nNow, we want to find out how many miles Chuck rode in total. We can do this by dividing the total miles by the total speed.\n\nTotal miles = Total miles (total miles) / Total speed (total miles) = 52 miles / 24 mph = 2.05 miles per hour.\n\nSo, Chuck rode 2.05 miles per hour, which is 2.05 * 3 = 6.15 miles in total.\n\nNow that we know his speed, we can find his speed when he rode out:\n\nSpeed = Total miles / Total speed = 6.15 miles / 52 miles = 0.125 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, Chuck rode 2.05 miles per hour, which is 2.05 * 3 = 6.15 miles in total."

      "To find $\\deg d$, we first need to identify the roots of the polynomial. The polynomial is given by $x^3 + 4x^2 - x + 12$.

Here, cosh is the cosine function, isin is the inverse cosine function, and cos^2(\u03b8) is the squared cosine function.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \\frac{2(\\cos(\\frac{\u03c0}{2})) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6})}{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(2\\pi/6))}\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \\frac{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(2\\pi/6))}{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(2\\pi/6))}\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \\frac{2(\\cos(3\\pi)/2 - \\cos(2\\pi/6))}{2(\\cos(3\\pi)/2 + \\cos(2\\pi/6))}\n\nSince $\\cos(3\\pi/2) = \\frac{1}{2}$, we get:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \\frac{2(\\cos(3\\pi)/2 + \\cos(2\\pi/6))}{2(\\cos(3\\pi)/2 - \\cos(2\\pi/6))}\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \\frac{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}\n\nSimplify:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \\frac{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \\frac{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}\n\nSimplify:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \\frac{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \\frac{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}\n\nSimplify:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \\frac{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}\n\nSimplify:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \\frac{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}\n\nSimplify:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \\frac{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}\n\nSimplify:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \\frac{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}{2(\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) + \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}))}\n\nSimplify:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \\frac{2(\\cos"

    "problem": "It takes Matt 2 minutes per problem to do his math homework with a calculator and a certain amount of time per problem without a calculator. If Matt's assignment has 20 problems, using a calculator will save him 60 minutes. How many minutes does it take Matt to do a problem without a calculator?",

      "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n- Matt needs to do 2 * 2 minutes per problem with a calculator, which is 2 minutes.\n- Matt needs to do 2 * 60 minutes per problem without a calculator, which is 120 minutes.\n\nSince the problem requires both 2 minutes and 120 minutes, we can set up an equation:\n\n2 * 2 minutes = 120 minutes\n\nNow, we can solve for minutes:\n\n2 minutes = 120 minutes / 2\n\nTo convert minutes to minutes, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n120 minutes / 2 = 60 minutes\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total time it takes Matt to complete the problem:\n\n60 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes Matt 120 minutes to complete the problem with a calculator.",
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that using a calculator saves Matt 60 minutes, and using a calculator without a calculator saves him 60 minutes.\n\nSince 20 problems can be divided into 20 equal parts, we can find the time it takes Matt to do a problem with a calculator by dividing the total number of problems by the time he spends on the calculator.\n\nMatt's assignment has 20 problems. Dividing 20 by 60 gives us 0.25 hours.\n\nNow, let's find the time it takes to do a problem without a calculator. Using a calculator, Matt spends 0.25 hours. To find the time it takes to do a problem with a calculator, we subtract the time he spends on the calculator from the time he spends on the calculator: 20 minutes (time it takes to do a problem with a calculator) - 0.25 hours (time it takes to do a problem with a calculator) = 20 minutes - 0.25 hours = 20 minutes - 0.75 hours.\n\nSince we know the total time it takes to do a problem with a calculator is 60 minutes, we can write the equation: 20 minutes - 0.75 hours = 60 minutes.\n\nNow, we can solve for the time it takes to do a problem with a calculator by dividing the total time it takes to do a problem with a calculator by the time it takes to do a problem without a calculator: 60 minutes / 0.75 hours = 80 minutes.\n\nSo, it takes Matt 80 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how long it takes Matt to do a problem with a calculator and a certain amount of time without a calculator.\n\nMatt's assignment has 20 problems, and 60 minutes are saved by using a calculator. To find the time it takes to do 20 problems with a calculator, we can divide the total time (60 minutes) by the time it takes to do 20 problems with a calculator (60 minutes per problem).\n\nTime (seconds) = Total time (minutes) / Time saved by calculator\nTime (minutes) = 20 * 60 / 60 = 4 hours\n\nNow, we can find the time it takes to do 20 problems with a calculator:\nTime (minutes) = 4 hours\n\nSo, it takes Matt 4 hours to do a problem with a calculator and 60 minutes per problem without a calculator.\n\nTo put this into \\boxed{}, we can rewrite the problem as:\n\nIt takes 2 minutes per problem to do his math homework with a calculator and a certain amount of time without a calculator. If he does 20 problems with a calculator, he saves 60 minutes. If he does 20 problems without a calculator, he saves 4 hours.\n\nSince it takes 4 hours to do 20 problems with a calculator, it takes 2 minutes per problem to do his math homework with a calculator and a certain amount of time without a calculator.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes Matt to complete the 20 problems using both a calculator and without a calculator.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time spent by both methods:\n\n- Using a calculator: 20 problems * 60 minutes/problem = 1200 minutes\n- Without a calculator: 20 problems * 10 minutes/problem = 20 minutes\n\nNow, let's add the time spent by each method:\n\n- Using a calculator: 1200 minutes + 20 minutes = 1220 minutes\n- Without a calculator: 20 minutes + 10 minutes = 20 minutes\n\nSince the total time spent by both methods is the same (1220 minutes), we can add them together:\n\n- Using a calculator: 1200 minutes + 20 minutes = 1220 minutes\n- Without a calculator: 20 minutes + 10 minutes = 20 minutes\n\nNow, let's divide the total time spent by the number of problems (20):\n\n- Using a calculator: 1220 minutes / 20 problems = 60 minutes\n- Without a calculator: 20 minutes / 20 problems = 1 minute\n\nSo, it takes Matt 60 minutes to complete the 20 problems using a calculator and 1 minute to complete the same problem without a calculator.",
