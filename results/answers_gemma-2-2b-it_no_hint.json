Since \u03b1 is in the second quadrant, where sine is positive and cosine is negative, we take cos \u03b1 = -1/4.\n\n3. **Substitute and Simplify:**\n   Now we can substitute the values of sin \u03b1, cos \u03b1, and the angle addition formula into the expression:\n   sin(\u03b1 + \u03c0/4) = (\u221a15/4) * (\u221a2/2) + (-1/4) * (\u221a2/2)\n   sin(\u03b1 + \u03c0/4) = (\u221a30 / 8) - (\u221a2/8) \n\n4. **Use the Double Angle Formulas:**\n   We can use the double angle formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the expression further:\n   sin 2\u03b1 = 2 sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1\n   cos 2\u03b1 = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2 \u03b1 \n   \n   Substitute the known values into the formulas:\n   sin 2\u03b1 = 2 * (\u221a15/4) * (-1/4) = -\u221a15/8\n   cos 2\u03b1 = 1 - 2 * (\u221a15/4)\u00b2 = 1 - 15/8 = 3/8\n\n5. **Substitute and Simplify:**\n   Now we can substitute these values back into the original expression:\n   [sin(\u03b1 + \u03c0/4) / (sin 2\u03b1 + cos 2\u03b1 + 1)] =  [(\u221a30/8) - (\u221a2/8)] / [( -\u221a15/8) + (3/8) + 1]\n\n6. **Simplify the Expression:**\n   Perform the remaining calculations to simplify the expression. \n\n\n**Final Answer** \n\nThe final answer will be a complex expression after simplifying. \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to continue working through the simplification!

We need to find the capacity of the tank.\n2. **Define Variables:**\n   *  Let 'x' represent the total number of litres in the tank. \n   *  Let 't' represent the time (in hours) the tank takes to be filled.\n3. **Set Up Equations:**\n   * **Inlet Pipe A:** Fills 6 litres per minute, so in 1 hour it fills 6 * 60 = 360 litres.\n   * **Inlet Pipe B:** Fills 4 litres per minute, so in 1 hour it fills 4 * 60 = 240 litres.\n   * **Combined Fill Rate:**  The combined fill rate of both pipes is 360 + 240 = 600 litres per hour.\n   * **Tank Emptying Rate:** The leak empties the tank at a rate of 1/3 of the tank per hour, meaning it empties 1/3 * x litres per hour.\n   * **Total Filling Time:** The tank is filled in 't' hours, and empties in 12 hours. \n\n4. **Formulate the Equations:**\n   * **Filling Equation:**  The tank is filled in 't' hours, and the combined fill rate is 600 litres per hour.

Identifying Key Values**\n\n*  We know the distance from point P to one focus is 3. Let's call this focus F\u2081.\n* We need to find the distance from point P to the other focus F\u2082. \n\n**4.  Finding the Distance (c)**\n\n* **a\u00b2 = 25:**  The semi-major axis (a) is the distance from the center of the ellipse to its vertices.\n* **b\u00b2 = 16:** The semi-minor axis (b) is the distance from the center of the ellipse to its co-vertices.\n* **c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 25 - 16 = 9**\n* **c = \u221a9 = 3** \n\n**5. Finding the Distance to the Other Focus**\n\n* Since the foci are on the major axis, they are located  a distance of 'c' from the center of the ellipse.\n* The other focus, F\u2082, is located a distance of 'c' from the center of the ellipse. \n\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{3} \n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Ellipse**\n\n* The equation $\\frac{x^{2}}{25} + \\frac{y^{2}}{16} = 1$ represents an ellipse centered at the origin (0,0) with a horizontal major axis.\n\n**2. Identifying the Key Features**\n\n* **Semi-major axis (a):** The value under the x\u00b2 term (25) is the semi-major axis. So, a = 5.\n* **Semi-minor axis (b):** The value under the y\u00b2 term (16) is the semi-minor axis. So, b = 4.\n* **Foci:**  The foci of an ellipse lie along the major axis, with a distance of 'c' from the center.  \n\n**3. Finding the Distance from a Point to a Focus**\n\n* The distance from a point P on the ellipse to one focus (F) can be found using the following formula:\n   *  PF = \u221a[(x - h)\u00b2 + (y - k)\u00b2] \n    * Where (h, k) is the center of the ellipse and PF is the distance from point P to focus F.\n\n**4. Applying the Formula**\n\n* We know the distance from point P to one focus (PF = 3). We need to find the distance to the other focus.\n* Let's call the other focus F'. We know that the distance between the two foci is 2c. \n\n**5. Calculating the Distance (c)**\n\n* Since the foci are on the major axis, the distance between the two foci (2c) is equal to 2a. \n*  We know that a = 5.\n*  Therefore, 2c = 2 * 5 = 10\n*  So, c = 5.\n\n**6. Finding the Distance from P to F'**\n\n* Now that we know c = 5, we can find the distance from point P to the other focus (F').\n* Using the same formula as before, we get:\n   * PF = \u221a[(x - h)\u00b2 + (y - k)\u00b2]\n   * PF = \u221a[(x - 0)\u00b2 + (y - 0)\u00b2]\n   * PF = \u221a[(x)\u00b2 + (y)\u00b2] \n\n**7.  Final Answer**\n\n* Since the distance from P to F' is 2c, we can substitute the value of c:\n   * **PF = 2 * 5 = 10**\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see any other examples. \n"

Express the price increase as a percentage:**\n\n*  The price increase can be expressed as a percentage by calculating the difference between the new price (y) and the original price (x) and dividing by the original price: (y - x)/x * 100%\n\n**6. Substitute and solve for the percentage increase:**\n\n*  We know that y = 1.10x and x = original price per gallon.\n*  Therefore, y = 1.10 * x\n*  The price increase is then (1.10 * x - x)/x * 100% = 10%\n\n\n**Answer:** The percentage increase in the price of gasoline is **10%**. \n",
      "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Define the variables:**\n   * Let 'x' represent the original price of gasoline per unit.\n   * Let 'y' represent the price increase after the percentage increase.\n\n2. **Set up the equation:**\n   * We know the driver intends to spend 10% more on gasoline, so the new price is y = 1.10x \n   * We also know that the driver reduces the quantity by 12%, meaning the quantity bought is now 88% of the original quantity.\n\n3. **Express the relationship between price and quantity:**\n   *  The price of gasoline is directly proportional to the quantity of gasoline bought.  \n\n4. **Formulate the equation:**\n   *  Since the price increase is 10%, we can represent this as 1.10x. \n   *  We need to find the percentage increase in the price of gasoline. \n   *  We can represent this as a percentage increase in price. \n\n\n5. **Solve for the percentage increase:**\n    *  Let's represent the price increase as a percentage of the original price. \n    *  We can express this as: (y - x) / x * 100%\n    *  We know y = 1.10x, so we can substitute that in: (1.10x - x) / x * 100%\n    *  Simplify: (0.10x) / x * 100% = 10%\n    \n \n \nAnswer: \\boxed{10\\%}. \n\n\n",

Set up the Equation:**\n\n* The driver wants to spend 10% more on gasoline, so the new price can be represented as: y = x + 0.10x \n* Simplifying the equation: y = 1.10x\n\n**3.  Understand the Relationship between Price and Quantity:**\n\n* The driver intends to buy 12% less gasoline. This means the new quantity is 88% of the original quantity (100% - 12% = 88%). \n\n**4. Express the Relationship Between Price and Quantity:**\n\n* We can express this relationship using the following equation:  y = 0.88x\n\n**5. Solve for the Percentage Increase:**\n\n*  We now have two equations:\n    * y = 1.10x \n    * y = 0.88x\n*  Set the two equations equal to each other: 1.10x = 0.88x\n*  Solve for x: 0.22x = 0\n*  Divide both sides by 0.22: x = 0\n*  The result of this is x = 0. This indicates that the price of gasoline must be $0.\n\n \n**Answer:  The percentage increase in the price of gasoline is 0%.** \n\n\n\n"

Standardize the Scores**\n\n* **Calculate the z-scores:**  A z-score tells you how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean. \n   *  For 80 points: z = (80 - 80) / 100 = 0\n   *  For 90 points: z = (90 - 80) / 100 = 1\n\n**4. Find the Probability from the Standard Normal Table**\n\n* **Use a z-table:**  A z-table provides the probabilities associated with different z-scores.\n* **Find the probability for z = 0 and z = 1:** Look up the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores in the z-table.\n    *  P(z < 0) = 0.5 \n    *  P(z < 1) = 0.8413\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability Between the Scores**\n\n*  The probability of scoring between 80 and 90 points is the difference between the probabilities of scoring below 90 and below 80.\n*  P(80 < X < 90) = P(z < 1) - P(z < 0) = 0.8413 - 0.5 = 0.3413\n\n**6. Interpret the Result**\n\nThe probability of a student scoring between 80 and 90 points is approximately **0.3413** or **34.13%**. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to try another problem! \n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Normal Distribution:**\n   * A normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve where most data points cluster around the mean.\n   * The mean (average) score is 80, and the standard deviation (spread) is 100.\n\n2. **Using the Z-Scores:**\n   * To find the number of students in a specific range, we use z-scores.\n   * The z-score tells us how many standard deviations a point is away from the mean. \n   * We need to calculate the z-scores for 80 and 90 points.\n\n3. **Calculating Z-scores:**\n   *  z-score for 80 points: z = (80 - 80) / 100 = 0\n   *  z-score for 90 points: z = (90 - 80) / 100 = 0.1\n\n4. **Finding the Area under the Curve:**\n   * We want the area under the normal distribution curve between z = 0 and z = 0.1. \n   * You can use a z-table (standard normal distribution table) to find the area corresponding to these z-scores. \n   * A z-table typically provides the area to the left of a given z-score.  \n\n5. **Interpreting the Area:**\n   *  The area to the left of z = 0.1 is approximately 0.5398 (from the z-table).\n   *  This means approximately 53.98% of the students scored below 90 points.\n\n6. **Calculating the Number of Students:**\n   *  We want to find the probability of students scoring between 80 and 90 points.\n   *  Since the area to the left of z = 0.1 is 0.5398 and the area under the curve is 1, we can find the area between 80 and 90 points by subtracting the area to the left of z = 0 from the area under the curve. \n   *  Therefore, the probability of scoring between 80 and 90 points is 1 - 0.5398 = 0.4602.\n\n   *  Since we are looking for the number of students, we need to multiply this probability by the total number of students: 0.4602 * 48 = 22.89.\n\n\n\n**Answer:** Approximately **23** students scored between 80 and 90 points. \n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the problem:**  We're given a normal distribution with a mean (average) of 80 and a standard deviation of 100. We need to find the approximate number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points.\n\n**2. Use the Z-score:**  The z-score tells us how many standard deviations a particular data point is away from the mean.  \n\n   *  For a z-score of 0, the data point is the mean. \n   *  For a z-score of 1, the data point is 1 standard deviation above the mean.\n   *  For a z-score of -1, the data point is 1 standard deviation below the mean.\n\n**3. Calculate the z-scores for 80 and 90:**\n\n   *  z-score for 80:  z = (80 - 80) / 100 = 0\n   *  z-score for 90: z = (90 - 80) / 100 = 0.1\n\n**4.  Find the area under the curve:** We want the area between the z-scores of 0 and 0.1. This represents the proportion of students who scored between 80 and 90 points.\n\n   * You can use a z-table or a calculator with statistical functions to find the area.  \n   *  Look up the area to the left of the z-score of 0.1 in a z-table. This will be the probability of scoring below 90.\n   *  Look up the area to the left of the z-score of 0 in a z-table. This will be the probability of scoring below 80.\n   *  Subtract the probability of scoring below 80 from the probability of scoring below 90. \n\n **5. Final answer:**  The approximate number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points is the area under the curve between these two z-scores.\n\n\n **Note:** It's important to remember that the normal distribution is symmetrical, so the area to the left of 0 is equal to the area to the right of 0. \n\n\n",
      "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Normal Distribution**\n\n* The normal distribution (represented by N(80, 100)) is a bell-shaped curve. \n* The mean (\u03bc) is 80, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 100.\n\n**2. Standardize the Scores**\n\n* We need to convert the scores of 80 and 90 into z-scores.

We need to find its equivalent in the range 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0.  \n   * 810\u00b0 - 360\u00b0 = 450\u00b0 \n   * 450\u00b0 is also more than a full rotation, so we need to convert it further. \n   * 450\u00b0 - 360\u00b0 = 90\u00b0 \n   * 90\u00b0 is a multiple of 360\u00b0 which means it's within the range of 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0.\n\n2. **Find the sine and cosine values:**\n   *  sin 90\u00b0 = 1 \n   *  cos (-60\u00b0) = cos 60\u00b0 = 1/2 \n\n3. **Add the values:**\n   * sin 810\u00b0 + cos (-60\u00b0) = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\n**Answer:**  \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}} \n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Units:**\n\n* **810\u00b0:**  This angle is coterminal with 360\u00b0 * 2 + 120\u00b0 = 810\u00b0. \n* **-60\u00b0:** This angle is coterminal with 360\u00b0 * 1 + 60\u00b0 = -60\u00b0.\n\n**2. Simplify the Trigonometric Functions:**\n\n* **sin 810\u00b0:**  Since the sine function has a period of 360\u00b0, we know sin(810\u00b0) = sin(360\u00b0 + 450\u00b0) = sin(450\u00b0)\n* **cos (-60\u00b0)** = cos(360\u00b0 + 60\u00b0) = cos(60\u00b0)\n\n**3. Use the Sine and Cosine Values:**\n\n* **sin 450\u00b0:** We can find the sine of 450\u00b0 by breaking it down: \n    * 450\u00b0 = 360\u00b0 + 90\u00b0\n    * sin(450\u00b0) = sin(360\u00b0) + sin(90\u00b0) = 0 + 1 = 1 \n* **cos 60\u00b0:** We know cos 60\u00b0 = 1/2.\n\n**4. Add the Values:**\n\n*  sin 810\u00b0 + cos (-60\u00b0) = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\n**Answer:**  \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}} \n"
