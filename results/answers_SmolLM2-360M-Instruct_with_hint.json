The height of the smaller trapezoid is $h$ and the height of the larger trapezoid is $h - c$ (where $c$ is the length of the base of the larger trapezoid).\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n$h^2 + (h - c)^2 = h^2$\n\nExpanding the squares, we get:\n\n$h^2 + h^2 - 2hc + c^2 = h^2$\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n$2hc = c^2 - 2hc$\n\nDividing both sides by $2h$, we get:\n\n$c^2 = (c/h)^2 - 2c/h$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to:\n\n$c^2 = (c/h)^2 - 2$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$c^4 = (c/h)^2 - 4$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$c^4 = (c^2 - 2)^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$c = \\pm \\sqrt{(c^2 - 2)^2}$\n\nSince $c$ is the length of the base of the trapezoid, the two possible values for $c$ are:\n\n$c = \\pm \\sqrt{(c^2 - 2)^2}$\n\nNow, let's find the lengths of the bases of the smaller trapezoids. The base $a$ of the smaller trapezoid is $a$ and the base $b$ of the smaller trapezoid is $b$.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem again to relate the lengths of the sides of the smaller trapezoid. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nLet's consider the smaller trapezoid with bases $a$ and $b$, and height $h$. The height of the smaller trapezoid is $h$ and the height of the larger trapezoid is $h - c$.\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n$h^2 + (h - c)^2 = h^2$\n\nExpanding the squares, we get:\n\n$h^2 + h^2 - 2hc + c^2 = h^2$\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n$2hc = c^2 - 2hc$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$c^2 = (c/h)^2 - 2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$c = \\pm \\sqrt{(c^2 - 2)^2}$\n\nSince $c$ is the length of the base of the trapezoid, the two possible values for $c$ are:\n\n$c = \\pm \\sqrt{(c^2 - 2)^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the lengths of the bases of the trapezoid. Let $a$ be the length of the base of the trapezoid and $b$ be the length of the base of the smaller trapezoid.\n\n$a = \\sqrt{(c/h)^2 - 2}$\n\n$b = \\sqrt{(c^2 - 2)^2}$\n\nTherefore, the bases of the original trapezoid are $a$ and $b$.",
      "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a right trapezoid with bases of lengths $c$ and $d$ and a side length equal to $c+d$ (which is not given in the problem). We want to find the lengths of the bases of the trapezoid.\n\nStep 2: Use similar triangles and the Pythagorean theorem\nConsider the two smaller trapezoids formed by the line parallel to the bases of the right trapezoid. They have bases of length $c$ and $d$, and the side length of one of the trapezoids is equal to $c+d$.\n\nThe hypotenuse of a right trapezoid is the side length $c+d$, and its length is equal to the sum of the two bases $c$ and $d$. Therefore, the height of the smaller trapezoid is $c+d$ - $c$ = $d$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem on the smaller trapezoid, we have:\n\n$$\nc^2 + d^2 = (c+d)^2\n$$\n\n$$\nc^2 + d^2 = c^2 + 2cd + d^2\n$$\n\n$$\n2cd = d^2\n$$\n\n$$\nc = d\n$$\n\nSince the base of the trapezoid is the sum of the bases $c$ and $d$, we have:\n\n$$\nc = d = c+d\n$$\n\nStep 3: Use the properties of similar triangles\nConsider the original trapezoid. Since the lateral sides of the trapezoid are equal to $c+d$, the two smaller trapezoids formed by the line parallel to the bases of the right trapezoid are similar to each other.\n\nThe ratio of the sides of the smaller trapezoids is equal to the ratio of the sides of the larger trapezoid:\n\n$$\n\\frac{c+d}{c} = \\frac{d}{c+d}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{c+d}{c+d}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{c+d}{c+d} = 1\n$$\n\n$$\nc+d = c\n$$\n\nStep 4: Verify the lengths of the bases\nSince the bases of the trapezoid are equal to $c+d$, and the ratio of the sides of the smaller trapezoids is equal to the ratio of the sides of the larger trapezoid, we can conclude that the lengths of the bases of the original trapezoid are equal to $c$ and $d$.\n\nTherefore, the lengths of the bases of the original trapezoid are $c$ and $d$."

      "To determine how many hours it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone, we can use the given information and the fact that Castel can dig the same hole in six hours.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how long it would take Castel to dig the hole if they worked together. We know that Castel can dig the hole in six hours. To find the time it would take Castel to dig the hole alone, we can divide six hours by the number of hours it would take Castel to dig the hole, which is six hours. This gives us a time of 1 hour.\n\nNow, let's use the given time difference to find how long it would take Ryan to dig the hole alone. We know that Ryan can dig the hole in 2.72727272727 hours if they work together. To find the time it would take Ryan to dig the hole alone, we can subtract six hours from the given time difference, which gives us 2.72727272727 - 6 = -3.72727272727 hours. This is less than six hours, which means it would take Ryan less than a full hour to dig the hole alone.\n\nHowever, we can also find the time it would take Ryan to dig the hole alone if they worked together by considering the given time difference. We know that Ryan can dig the hole in 2.72727272727 hours if they work together. To find the time it would take Ryan to dig the hole alone, we can divide 2.72727272727 hours by the number of hours it would take Castel to dig the hole, which is six hours. This gives us a time of 2.72727272727 / 6 = 0.4535923076953172.\n\nSince we want to find the time it would take Ryan to dig the hole alone, we can subtract this time from the given time difference. Subtracting 0.4535923076953172 from 2.72727272727 gives us a time of 2.46353172727 hours.\n\nTherefore, it would take Ryan approximately 2.46 hours to dig the hole alone.",
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nRyan can dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole in a certain amount of time. We'll assume that the time taken for Ryan to dig the hole is represented by x hours.\n\nCastel can dig the same hole in six hours. We'll assume that the time taken for Castel to dig the hole is represented by y hours.\n\nWe know that it takes Ryan and Castel together 2.72727272727 hours to dig the hole. This is represented by the equation:\n\nx + y = 2.72727272727\n\nWe want to find out how long it takes Ryan to dig the hole alone. We can do this by subtracting the time it takes for Ryan and Castel to dig the hole from the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole. This is represented by:\n\nx - y = 10 - 6 = 4 hours\n\nSo, it takes Ryan 4 hours to dig the hole alone.",
      "To solve this problem, let's first understand the given information.

So, together, they can dig 5 ft / hour + 5 ft / hour = 10 ft / hour.\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it would take them to dig the hole alone. We know that together, they can dig 10 ft / hour. To find the time it would take them to dig the hole alone, we can divide the total distance (10 ft) by their combined rate (10 ft / hour).\n\nTime to dig the hole alone = Total distance / Combined rate\nTime to dig the hole alone = 10 ft / hour / 10 ft / hour\nTime to dig the hole alone = 1 hour\n\nSo, it would take Ryan and Castel 1 hour to dig the hole alone.",
      "To find out how many hours it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone, we need to first calculate how many hours it would take Castel and Ryan working together. \n\nThe combined rate of digging is the sum of the rates at which Ryan and Castel work together. We know that it takes Ryan and Castel 2.72727272727 hours to dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole together. \n\nSo, the combined rate of digging is 2.72727272727 hours per 10 ft by 10 ft hole. To find out how many hours it would take them to dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole individually, we can divide the total time by the rate of digging. \n\n2.72727272727 hours per 10 ft by 10 ft hole divided by 2.72727272727 hours per 10 ft by 10 ft hole divided by 6 hours per 1 hour is 100 / 33.333333333333333. \n\nNow, we can simplify the division to 100 / 33.333333333333333. To convert this to a mixed number or decimal, we can divide 100 by 33.333333333333333, which gives us 2 with a remainder of 16. \n\nSo, it would take Castel and Ryan working together 2 hours and 16 minutes to dig the hole alone.",
      "To find out how many hours it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone, we first need to understand the time it takes for Castel and Ryan to dig the hole together. \n\nRyan can dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole in 6 hours. If we divide the total area of the hole (10 ft by 10 ft) by the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole (6 hours), we get 10 ft / 6 hours = 5/3 hours. \n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for Castel to dig the same hole. Since Castel can dig the hole in 2.72727272727 hours if they work together, we can find this time by dividing the total area of the hole by Castel's rate of digging: 10 ft / 2.72727272727 hours = 3.673737373737374 hours.\n\nNow we can find out how many hours it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone by dividing the total area of the hole by Ryan's rate of digging: 10 ft / 5 hours = 2 hours.\n\nSo, it takes Ryan 2 hours to dig the hole alone.",

This means that Castel's rate of digging is 10 ft / 60 minutes = 1/6 hour.\n\nNow, we need to find the combined rate at which they can dig the hole. To do this, we need to find the product of their individual rates. We can do this by multiplying the rate of Ryan by the rate of Castel.\n\nSo, the combined rate at which they can dig the hole is: 1 hour * 1/6 hour = 1/6 hour.\n\nTo convert this to hours, we can multiply by 60 minutes per hour.

      "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the situation:\n\nRyan can dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole in a certain amount of time. This means that Ryan's rate of digging is 10 ft/hr.\n\nCastel can dig the same hole in six hours. This means that Castel's rate of digging is 6 hr/hr.\n\nWe can set up a proportion to find out how many hours it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone:\n\nRyan's rate / Castel's rate = (10 ft / hr) / (6 hr / hr)\n\nFirst, we'll simplify the fraction:\n\n(10 ft / hr) / (6 hr / hr) = 10 ft / (6 hr / hr)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common factor of 6:\n\n10 ft / (6 hr / hr) = 10 ft / 6 hr\n\nThe 6 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\n10 ft / 6 hr = 1.67 ft / hr\n\nNow, we can convert this to hours by dividing by 60:\n\n(1.67 ft / hr) / (60 hr / min) = 1.67 ft / hr / (60 hr / min)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the fraction to express it as a decimal:\n\n1.67 ft / hr / (60 hr / min) = 1.67 / 60\n\nNow, we can convert the fraction to a decimal:\n\n1.67 / 60 = 0.0272727272727...\n\nSo, it would take Ryan and Castel 2.72727272727 hours to dig the hole together.",

      "To solve this problem, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n- Ryan can dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole in a certain amount of time. This means that, in hours, Ryan can dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole.\n- Castel can dig the same hole in 6 hours. This means that Castel can dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole in 6 * 6 = 36 hours.\n- It would take them 2.72727272727 hours if they worked together. This means that together, Ryan and Castel can dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole in 2.72727272727 / 6 = 4.5 hours.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation based on the given information:\n\nLet's say x is the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone. Since it would take them 2.72727272727 hours if they worked together, we can write:\n\n2.72727272727 / x = 4.5\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by x:\n\n2.72727272727 * x = 4.5 * x\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n\n2.72727272727 * x = 4.5x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2.72727272727:\n\nx = 4.5x / 2.72727272727\n\nx = 1.8\n\nTherefore, it would take Ryan and Castel 1.8 hours to dig the hole alone.",
      "To determine how many hours it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone, we can start by considering the amount of time it takes for them to dig the hole together. We know that Ryan can dig the hole in 10 hours, and Castel can dig it in 6 hours.\n\nWhen they work together, the total amount of work is being done, so we can represent the time it takes for them to dig the hole as 6 hours + 10 hours = 16 hours.\n\nHowever, we need to account for the fact that they are working together, so we need to add their individual rates of work. The rate at which Castel digs the hole is 6 hours / 6 hours = 1 hour per hour. The rate at which Ryan digs the hole is 10 hours / 10 hours = 1 hour per hour.\n\nSince they are working together, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates. So, together, they are digging 1 hour per hour (Ryan) + 1 hour per hour (Castel) = 2 hours per hour.\n\nNow, we want to find the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone. We know that 2 hours per hour is the same as 2 * 6 = 12 hours. Therefore, it will take Ryan 12 hours to dig the hole alone.\n\nSo, the final answer is 12 hours.",
      "To find out how long it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone, we need to divide the total area of the hole by the time it takes for Ryan to dig it.\n\nArea of the hole: 10 ft * 10 ft = 100 ft^2\nTime it takes for Ryan to dig it: 6 hours\n\nTime it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone: 100 ft^2 / 6 hours = 16.67 hours\n\nSo, it takes Ryan 16.67 hours to dig the hole alone."

Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, we can find the number of solutions by counting the number of integers in the range $[0, \\infty)$ and adding 1 to account for the case when $x=0$ and $y=0$.\n\nThere are 2^1 = 2 ways to choose the value of $x$ from the range $[0, \\infty)$. Since $x$ must be an integer, there are 2 ways to choose the value of $x$. Similarly, there are 2 ways to choose the value of $y$ from the range $[0, \\infty)$.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nFinally, we can find the natural number $A$ such that there are $A$ integer solutions to the inequality $x+y \\geq A$ by solving the equation $2^2 = 4$.\n\n$2^2 = 4$\n\n$4 = 2^2$\n\n$2^2 = 4$\n\n$4 = 2^2$\n\n$2^2 = 4$\n\nTherefore, the natural number $A$ is 4.",

The interval $(-\\infty, 1)$ is open and does not include $1$, so $a + b$ is not an interval. The interval $(4, +\\infty)$ is also open and does not include $1$, so $a + b$ is not an interval.\n\nTherefore, $a + b$ is not an interval, but it can be a point. To find the value of $a + b$, we need to consider the intervals between $a$ and $b$. Since $a + b$ is an interval, it can be either a point or a half-interval.\n\nLet's consider the intervals $(-\\infty, 1)$ and $(4, +\\infty)$. If $a + b$ is an interval, it can be either $1$ or $4$. If $a + b$ is a point, it can be either $1$ or $4$.\n\nIn this case, since $a + b$ is an interval, it can be either $1$ or $4$. If $a + b$ is $1$, then $a + b = 1 + b = 2b$ and $a + b = 1 + b = 2b$. Since $a + b = 1 + b$ and $a + b = 2b$, we can conclude that $a + b = 1 + 2b = 3b$.\n\nOn the other hand, if $a + b$ is $4$, then $a + b = 4 + b = 5 + b$. Since $a + b = 4 + b$, we can conclude that $a + b = 5 + 4 = 9$.\n\nIn either case, we can find the value of $a + b$ by considering the intervals between $a$ and $b$.",

To do this, we set the two expressions equal to zero and solve for $a$ and $b$.\n\nSetting $\\frac{x-a}{x-b} = 0$, we get $x - a = 0$, which gives $a = x$. Similarly, setting $\\frac{x-a}{x-b} = 0$, we get $x - b = 0$, which gives $b = x$.\n\nTherefore, the critical points are $x = -a$ and $x = b$. Now, we need to consider the intervals between these points to determine the sign of the expression.\n\nFor $x = -a$, we have $x-a > 0$, so the expression becomes $x > a$. For $x = b$, we have $x-b > 0$, so the expression becomes $b < x$.\n\nFor $x = -a$, $x-a > 0$, so the expression becomes $x < a$.

For $x > 4$, the expression is $x-a$, which is negative.\n\nSo, the value of $a + b$ is $1 - (-1) = 2$."

We can express this weight as:\n\nWeight of chair = Length of chair * Weight of chair per meter\nWeight of chair = 4 m * 2.8 kg/m\nWeight of chair = 11.2 kg\n\nNow, we can find the combined weight of the bag and chair by adding their weights:\n\nCombined weight = Weight of bag + Weight of chair\nCombined weight = 14.25 kg + 11.2 kg\nCombined weight = 25.45 kg\n\nSo, the combined weight of the bag and chair is 25.45 kilograms (kg).",
      "To find the combined weight of the bag and chair, we first need to determine the total length of the items and then multiply it by the weight per meter.\n\nThe length of the bag is 5 meters, and it weighs 29/8 kilograms. To find the weight per meter, we can convert the fraction 29/8 to a decimal, which is 3.125. Now, we can multiply the length of the bag by the weight per meter to find the total weight:\n\n5 meters * 3.125 kilograms/meter = 15.625 kilograms\n\nThe length of the chair is 4 meters, and it weighs 2.8 kilograms. To find the weight per meter, we can convert the fraction 2.8 to a decimal, which is 2.8/10 = 0.28. Now, we can multiply the length of the chair by the weight per meter to find the total weight:\n\n4 meters * 0.28 kilograms/meter = 1.12 kilograms\n\nNow, we can add the total weight of the bag and chair to find the combined weight:\n\n15.625 kilograms + 1.12 kilograms = 17.745 kilograms\n\nSo, the combined weight of the bag and chair is approximately 17.75 kilograms.",
      "Step 1: Calculate the combined weight of the bag and chair.\n\nThe bag has a length of 5 meters, and it weighs 29/8 kilograms. Multiply 29/8 by 5 to get the combined weight:\n\n29/8 * 5 = 17.5\n\nThe chair has a length of 4 meters, and it weighs 2.8 kilograms.

      "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the combined weight of the two items. First, we need to find the combined weight of the bag and the chair.\n\nThe length of the bag is 5 m and the weight is 29/8 kg. To convert the fraction 29/8 to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 29/8 = 3.625.\n\nSo, the combined weight of the bag is 29/8 kg + 3.625 kg = 3.15 kg.\n\nThe length of the chair is 4 m and the weight is 2.8 kg. To convert the fraction 2.8 kg to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 2.8/2 = 1.4.\n\nSo, the combined weight of the chair is 2.8 kg + 1.4 kg = 4.2 kg.\n\nNow, we need to find the combined weight of the bag and the chair.

Therefore, the value of a \u2208 (0, \u03c0) such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) always holds true is -\u221a2/2.",
      "To find the value of a \u2208 (0, \u03c0) such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) always holds true, we first need to analyze the given function f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4). \n\nThe function f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) is a periodic function with a period of \u03c0/2. The period of a function f(x) = sin(ax + \u03c0/2) is a + \u03c0/2, where a is a real number.\n\nWe are looking for a value of a such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) always holds true. To find this value, we can rewrite f(x) as f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) = sin(a) * sin(2x - \u03c0/4).\n\nNow, we have two equations: sin(a) * sin(2x - \u03c0/4) = sin(a) * sin(2x - \u03c0/4) and sin(a) * sin(2x - \u03c0/4) = sin(a) * sin(2x - \u03c0/4).\n\nNotice that the right-hand side of both equations is the same, so we can equate the two expressions: sin(a) * sin(2x - \u03c0/4) = sin(a) * sin(2x - \u03c0/4).\n\nThis implies that sin(a) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4). \n\nSince we are looking for a value of a that satisfies this condition, we can take the inverse sine (arcsine) of both sides, which gives us a = \u03c0/4.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the fact that the period of sin(2x - \u03c0/4) is \u03c0/2, not \u03c0. Therefore, a must be an integer multiple of \u03c0/2.\n\nHence, a = \u03c0/2, which is the value of a \u2208 (0, \u03c0) such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) always holds true.",
      "To find the value of a \u2208 (0, \u03c0) such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) always holds true, we can use the given function f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4). We can rewrite the equation as f(x+a) = f(x+3a) by subtracting f(x+3a) from f(x+a), which is valid since f(x+a) and f(x+3a) are the same function.\n\nSince the function f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) is even, we know that f(-x) = f(x) for all x. Therefore, we can write f(x+a) = f(x+3a) = f(-a) = f(-3a).\n\nNow, we have f(-a) = f(a) = sin(2a - \u03c0/4). Since sin(2a - \u03c0/4) = sin(2a) * sin(\u03c0/4) = sin(2a), we can write f(-a) = f(a) = sin(2a).\n\nNow we have f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) = sin(2a), which means that f(x) is equal to sin(2a) for all x. Therefore, the condition f(x+a) = f(x+3a) always holds true is equivalent to f(x+a) = f(x+3a) = sin(2a).\n\nSince the sine function is periodic with period \u03c0, we can write sin(2a) as sin(2a) = sin(2a + \u03c0/2) = sin(2a + \u03c0/4) = sin(2a + \u03c0/2 - \u03c0/4) = sin(2a - \u03c0/4).\n\nHowever, since the period of sin(2a) is \u03c0, we can conclude that sin(2a) is an odd function, and sin(2a - \u03c0/4) is an odd function. Therefore, we can conclude that sin(2a) is an odd function for all a.\n\nSo, the value of a \u2208 (0, \u03c0) such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) always holds true is sin(2a) = sin(2a - \u03c0/4), which is equivalent to 2a = \u03c0/2 + \u03c0/4.\n\nSince 2a = \u03c0/2 + \u03c0/4, we can rewrite this as 2a = \u03c0/2 + \u03c0/4 - \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/2.\n\nTherefore, the value of a \u2208 (0, \u03c0) such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) always holds true is 1.\n\nSo, the value of a \u2208 (0, \u03c0) such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) always holds true is 1.\n\nExpress your answer in radians as a fraction of \u03c0.",

      "To find the smallest angle of $\\triangle ABC$, we can use the fact that the smallest angle is opposite to the side opposite the smallest angle. Let's denote the smallest angle as $\\theta$. We know that the smallest angle is opposite side $\\overline{AB}$, which is $4$.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we can relate the side lengths of the triangle to the cosine of the angle opposite to that side.

Since the zero is in the opposite direction, we would need to travel 5 kilometers to the west in order to be in the same direction as the car.\n\nTherefore, the car would be recorded as 5 kilometers to the west.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to consider the direction of movement and how it affects the measurement of distance.\n\nIf a car travels 5 kilometers to the east, it is recorded as 5 kilometers. This is because the direction of movement is east, which is considered positive.\n\nNow, if the car then travels 5 kilometers to the west, the direction of movement would be west, which is considered negative. So, if the car travels 5 kilometers to the west, it is still recorded as 5 kilometers, but its new position would be 5 kilometers east of the starting point, since it traveled 5 kilometers east and 5 kilometers west, resulting in a net displacement of 0 kilometers.\n\nTherefore, traveling 5 kilometers to the west would be recorded as 5 kilometers.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to consider the concept of direction in relation to zero. The direction of travel is relative to the starting point or zero. In the context of the problem, the direction of travel is measured from the east direction.\n\nWhen a car travels 5 kilometers to the east, we can conclude that its direction is 5 kilometers east of zero. Since the direction of travel is relative to the starting point, the distance from zero to the west can be calculated as the sum of the distance from zero to east and the distance from zero to west.\n\nThe distance from zero to east is 5 kilometers, and the distance from zero to west is also 5 kilometers. Therefore, the total distance traveled is 5 kilometers east and 5 kilometers west, which is 10 kilometers.\n\nSo, the correct answer to the question of how traveling 5 kilometers to the west would be recorded is 10 kilometers.",
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nWhen a car travels 5 kilometers to the east, its direction is 5 kilometers east. This means that if we move 5 kilometers to the east, we are moving in the direction of 5 kilometers east.\n\nNow, if a car travels 5 kilometers to the west, its direction is 5 kilometers west. This means that if we move 5 kilometers west, we are moving in the direction of 5 kilometers west.\n\nSo, when a car travels 5 kilometers to the west, its direction is the opposite of its direction to the east. In other words, if we move 5 kilometers to the west, we are moving in the direction of 5 kilometers south.\n\nTherefore, traveling 5 kilometers to the west would be recorded as 5 kilometers south.",
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe car is initially recorded as 5 kilometers to the east. This means that it is moving east at a rate of 5 kilometers per second. When it travels 5 kilometers to the west, it is essentially moving in the opposite direction, but in a direction that is 5 kilometers to the west of its original starting point.\n\nIn this case, the direction of the car is still east, but the magnitude of the travel is 5 kilometers west of its original starting point. This means that the car has traveled 5 kilometers to the west.\n\nSo, if a car travels 5 kilometers to the east, it is recorded as 5 kilometers. If it travels 5 kilometers to the west, it is recorded as -5 kilometers.",
      "To determine the direction of traveling 5 kilometers to the west, we can use the concept of direction in relation to zero. In this case, we can consider 5 kilometers to the west as 5 kilometers in the opposite direction of 0 kilometers. Since 5 kilometers to the east is 0 kilometers, we can conclude that traveling 5 kilometers to the west is 5 kilometers in the opposite direction of 0 kilometers.\n\nSo, the direction of traveling 5 kilometers to the west would be 5 kilometers in the opposite direction of 0 kilometers, which is 5 kilometers east. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 kilometers east.",
      "To find the correct direction, we need to consider the relative difference between the two directions. Since we are traveling 5 kilometers to the east, we know that the direction we are moving is 5 kilometers to the east.\n\nIf we were to travel 5 kilometers to the west, we would need to subtract the direction we are currently moving (east) from the direction we are moving to the west (west). This would result in a net movement of 5 kilometers in the opposite direction.\n\nTherefore, traveling 5 kilometers to the west would be recorded as -5 kilometers, which is equal to -5 * 1000 meters, or -5000 meters. So, the correct answer is -5000 meters.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of direction in relation to zero. When we travel 5 kilometers to the east, we are effectively moving in the negative direction, which is to the east. The direction of movement is always in relation to zero, which is the direction we are starting from.\n\nIf we travel 5 kilometers to the west, we are essentially moving in the positive direction, which is to the west. The direction of movement is again in relation to zero, but this time it is to the west.\n\nSo, the correct representation of 5 kilometers to the west would be 5 kilometers, but expressed in a way that is consistent with the concept of direction in relation to zero. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 kilometers.",
      "When a car travels 5 kilometers to the east, it is recorded as 5 kilometers.\n\nTo understand this, we need to consider the concept of direction in relation to zero. Since 5 kilometers east is equivalent to 0 kilometers west, it's clear that traveling 5 kilometers east is equivalent to 5 kilometers west.\n\nIn other words, if we start at 0 kilometers east and move 5 kilometers to the east, we are now 5 kilometers west of our original starting point. This is because the direction is the same as the movement, not the magnitude of the movement."

      "To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage increase in the price of gasoline.\n\nFirst, let's find the new price of gasoline after the driver reduces the quantity of gasoline by 12%.

The driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline. This means the new price of gasoline is x% of the original price.\n3. Since the driver is only spending 10% more, the new quantity of gasoline is x% of the original quantity.\n4. The new quantity of gasoline is 12% more than the original quantity. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx * (original quantity / 100) = 12 * (new quantity / 100)\n\nTo find the new quantity, we can cross-multiply:\n\nx * 100 = 12 * (new quantity / 100)\n\nNow, let's solve for the new quantity:\n\nx = (12 * (new quantity / 100)) / 100\nx = (12 * new quantity) / 100\n\nNow we can set up the equation:\n\n(12 * new quantity) / 100 = (100 * x) / 100\n\nx = 1200 / 100\nx = 12\n\nSo the new quantity of gasoline is 12%.\n\nNow we can find the percentage increase in the price of gasoline:\n\nPercentage increase = ((new quantity / original quantity) - 1) * 100\n= ((12 / 100) - 1) * 100\n= (0.12 - 1) * 100\n= -10%\n\nThe percentage increase in the price of gasoline is -10%.",

      "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Find the new price of gasoline with the increased price.\nWe know the original price of gasoline is 50 dollars, and the price of gasoline with the 10% increase is 60 dollars.\n\nStep 2: Find the new quantity of gasoline that the driver buys.\nThe driver wants to spend only 10% more on gasoline, so he should buy 100% - 10% = 90% of the original quantity.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the new quantity of gasoline.\nThe driver buys 90% of the original quantity, so he buys 0.9 * 50 = 45 gallons of gasoline.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the new price of gasoline.\nThe price of gasoline with the 10% increase is 60 dollars, so the new price of gasoline is 50 + (60 * 0.10) = 50 + 6 = 56 dollars.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the percentage increase in the price of gasoline.\nThe price of gasoline with the 10% increase is 60 dollars, and the price of gasoline with the 12% increase is 60 + (60 * 12 / 100) = 60 + 7.2 = 67.2 dollars.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the percentage increase.\nTo find the percentage increase, divide the difference by the original price, then multiply by 100:\n\n(67.2 - 56) / 56 * 100 = 18.4%\n\nSo, the price of gasoline with the 10% increase is 67.2 dollars, and the driver should reduce the quantity of gasoline by 12%, resulting in a 18.4% increase in the price of gasoline.",
      "Let's start by analyzing the situation: the price of gasoline increases by a certain percentage and a driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline. We need to find out how much the driver should reduce the quantity of gasoline to maintain the same price.\n\nFirst, let's find the original price of gasoline. We don't know the exact price, but we can find it by applying the given percentage increase to the original price. Since the price increases by 10%, the original price would be 100% + 10% = 110%.\n\nNow, we want to find out how much the driver should reduce the quantity of gasoline to maintain the same price. To do this, we need to find the new quantity that would bring the price to the original price. We can do this by applying the percentage increase to the original quantity.\n\nLet's use the given percentage increase of 10% to find the new quantity:\n\nNew quantity = Original quantity * (1 + percentage increase)\nNew quantity = 110% * (1 + 10%)\nNew quantity = 110% * 110%\nNew quantity = 1210%\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage increase in the price of gasoline. To do this, we need to find the difference between the new price and the original price:\n\nPercentage increase = (New price - Original price) / Original price\nPercentage increase = (1210% - 110%) / 110%\nPercentage increase = 101%\n\nSo, the percentage increase in the price of gasoline is 101%."

      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, we know that Megan deleted 67 files, which means she took away 67/12 = 5 files from each folder. This means that each folder can hold 5 files. However, we're asked about the number of folders, and we don't know how many folders Megan initially had.\n\nSince Megan had 256 files initially and she deleted 67, we can subtract 67 from 256 to find the number of files she left after deleting. 256 - 67 = 189.\n\nNow, we need to divide this number by 12, since each folder can hold 12 files. 189 / 12 = 16.\n\nHowever, we should also consider the remainder, which is 189 - 16 * 12 = 189 - 192 = 7.\n\nSince Megan had 7 files left after deleting, she put them into folders with 12 files in each. This means she put 7 / 12 = 1/2 of the 7 files into each folder.\n\nSo, Megan ended up with 7 files in her folders, but this is not the correct number of folders. Instead, Megan had 7 files in her folders, and she put them into 7 folders with 12 files in each. To find the correct number of folders, we need to divide 7 files by 12, which equals 0.5833 (rounded to 4 decimal places).\n\nSince Megan has 7 files and she put them into 7 folders, the correct number of folders she had initially is 7 (files) * 7 (folders) = 49.\n\nSo, Megan ended up with 49 folders.",
      "To find the number of folders Megan had, we need to divide the number of files she deleted (67) by the number of files in each folder (12).\n\n67 / 12 = 5\n\nSince 5 is a whole number, we can divide Megan's files by 12 to find the number of folders.\n\n256 / 12 = 21\n\nThere are 21 folders.",
      "To find the number of folders, we need to divide Megan's total number of files by the number of files in each folder.

To find the number of folders, we divide the remaining number of files by the number of files in each folder: 2749 files / 12 files per folder = 229.57 folders.\n\nHowever, since the number of files is an integer (2749), we round down to the nearest whole number to ensure the number of folders is evenly distributed into Megan's original 12-folder structure. The number of folders is 229.",

Since Megan has 189 files left after deleting 67, we can divide the number of files by the number of files she deleted: 189 / 67 \u2248 2.81. This means Megan has approximately 2.81 files left.\n\nHowever, we should also consider the remainder to ensure the number of files is evenly distributed into folders. Since Megan has 189 files, she has 189 / 12 = 15.33 folders. The remainder, which is 2.81, is not evenly divisible by 12, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Applying this rule to $F(x)$, we get $F'(x) = a(7)x^6 + b(5)x^5 + c(3)x^3 + d - 6$.\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of $F(-2)$. We can do this by substituting $x = -2$ into the derivative we just found: $F'(x) = a(7)(-2)^6 + b(5)(-2)^5 + c(-3)(-2)^3 + d - 6$.

Therefore, $F(x) = a(-8)^7 + b(-8)^5 + c(-2)^3 + d - 6$.\n\nSince $F(x)$ is a polynomial, we can use the fact that $a = 1$ to simplify the equation.

      "Let's start by analyzing the sequence of powers of 3. Each term in the sequence is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 3. Therefore, the sequence starts as 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, \u2026 .\n\nNow, let's examine the sequence in terms of binary numbers. Binary numbers are sequences of 0s and 1s, which are the building blocks of digital computers. Each binary digit (or bit) can have a value of either 0 or 1.\n\nNotice that each term in the sequence corresponds to a binary number. For example, the term 9 in the sequence is equivalent to the binary number 1001, and the term 12 is equivalent to the binary number 10100.\n\nTo find the 100th term of the sequence, we need to find the 100th term of the sequence of binary numbers. Since each binary number is 3 more than the previous one, we can think of the sequence as a sequence of 3-digit binary numbers.\n\nThe first 3-digit binary number is 100, which is equivalent to the binary number 1001. The second 3-digit binary number is 101, which is equivalent to the binary number 1010. The third 3-digit binary number is 110, which is equivalent to the binary number 10100.\n\nTherefore, the 100th term of the sequence is 10100.",
      "To find the 100th term of the sequence formed by all powers of 3, let's first understand how this sequence is constructed. We can form the sequence by adding consecutive powers of 3 to the previous term.\n\nThe sequence starts with 1, and each subsequent term is obtained by adding the next power of 3 to the previous term. For example, the 10th term would be 1 + 3 = 4, and the 11th term would be 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nNow, let's analyze how this sequence relates to powers of 3. Binary numbers are a way of representing numbers using only two digits: 0 and 1. Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2. For example, the binary number 1010 would represent the power of 2 2^2 (or 4) plus 2^1 (or 2) plus 2^0 (or 1).\n\nSince we're dealing with powers of 3, let's think about how binary numbers work with powers of 3. If we have a power of 3, say 3^n, we can think of it as the binary number 1010 in base 2. This is because 3^n = 1010 in base 2, and the sum of these digits is equal to the power of 3.\n\nNow, let's consider how we can relate this sequence to powers of 3. If we have a term in the sequence, say 9, we can think of it as 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0. This is the same as 9 = 3^3, so the term 9 is the 3^3 term in the sequence.\n\nTo find the 100th term, we can simply multiply the 3^3 term by 100. This is because 100 is the 100th power of 3.\n\nTherefore, the 100th term of the sequence is 9 * 100 = 900.",
      "To find the 100th term of the sequence, we first need to understand how the sequence progresses. The sequence starts with 1, then 3, and so on. This is a classic example of a sequence formed by powers of 3, where each term is obtained by raising 3 to the power of the term number.\n\nIn binary, powers of 2 are represented as 1s and 0s. For example, the binary representation of 2 is 10, 3 is 11, and 4 is 100. This means that each term in the sequence can be represented as a binary number.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can represent the 100th term of the sequence in binary. Since the sequence starts with 1, we can represent the 100th term as 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",

This is because the binary representation of a power of 3 is always a sequence of 1s, which can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.\n\nNow, we can see that the 100th term of the sequence is equivalent to 11000101 in binary, which can be represented as 11000101 in decimal.",
      "To find the 100th term of the sequence, we need to understand how binary numbers work and how powers of 3 relate to them.\n\nA binary number is a sequence of 0s and 1s, where each digit (or bit) represents a power of 2. The most significant bit (MSB) represents the power of 2 that is raised to the highest power in the sequence.\n\nLet's break down the sequence into its constituent powers of 3. The sequence starts with 1 (which corresponds to the power of 3^0). The next term is 3 (which corresponds to the power of 3^1). The next term is 4 (which corresponds to the power of 3^2). The next term is 9 (which corresponds to the power of 3^3). The next term is 10 (which corresponds to the power of 3^4). The next term is 12 (which corresponds to the power of 3^5). The next term is 13 (which corresponds to the power of 3^6). The sequence continues in this manner, with each term being 1 more than the previous term, and the MSB being the highest power in the sequence.\n\nNow, we need to find the 100th term in this sequence. We can do this by adding 1 to the 100th term of the sequence, which corresponds to the power of 3^10. Since we are adding 1 to a power of 3, we can use the fact that the 100th term is 1 more than the 100th term of the sequence.\n\nSo, the 100th term of the sequence is 100.\n\nTherefore, the 100th term of the sequence is 100.",
      "To find the 100th term of the sequence, we need to determine how the sequence progresses based on powers of 3.\n\nLet's consider the sequence: 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, \u2026\n\nWe can think of the sequence as a binary sequence where each term is the sum of a power of 3 and one of the previous terms. To do this, we can use the formula for binary numbers:\n\nBinary number = (1 x 3^0) + (0 x 3^1) + (1 x 3^2) + (0 x 3^3) + (1 x 3^4) + (1 x 3^5) + \u2026\n\nIn our case, the binary number would be 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + \u2026\n\nNotice that the sequence is formed by adding powers of 3 to the previous term. This is a direct result of the binary representation of powers of 3.\n\nNow, let's find the 100th term of the sequence.

The key insight here is that $x^2+ax+b$ is a quadratic equation, and we can use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots.\n\nVieta's formulas state that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is given by $-a/2$. In this case, we have $x^2+ax+b=0$, so the sum of the roots is $-a/2$.\n\nTo find the sum of the roots, we can factor the quadratic equation as $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d)=0$. Expanding this product, we get $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d)=x^4+dx^2+ax^2+cx^2+ax+bx+cx+d$.\n\nNow, we have a quartic equation in terms of $x$.

The area of each part is the area of the square carpet.\n\nThe total area of the carpet is 64 square meters. The area of the carpet is equal to the area of the 10 m long rectangle. Therefore, the area of the carpet is 10 m * 10 m = 100 square meters.\n\nThe uncovered portion of the floor is 64 square meters. Since the area of the uncovered portion is the difference between the total area of the floor and the area of the carpet, we can write:\n\nArea of uncovered portion = Total area of floor - Area of carpet\n= 64 square meters - 100 square meters\n= -44 square meters\n\nThe total area of the floor is 64 square meters. Therefore, the width of the floor is the difference between the total area of the floor and the area of the uncovered portion:\n\nWidth of floor = Total area of floor - Area of uncovered portion\n= 64 square meters - 44 square meters\n= 10 m\n\nSo, the width of the floor is 10 meters."

To find the total number of pages in each book, we can add the number of pages in each book: 396 + 297 = 693.\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the number of pages in the shortest book to the longest book by dividing the number of pages in the shortest book by the number of pages in the longest book: 693 / 297.\n\nTo perform this division, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 297 and 396 is 1384. So, we can rewrite the ratio as (693 / 1384) / (297 / 1384).\n\nTo simplify this ratio, we can find a common denominator of 1384. This gives us (693 / 1384) / (297 / 1384) = (17 / 2) * (1384 / 1384).\n\nSince the numerator and denominator are the same, the ratio is simply 17:1.",

      "Matt's homework assignment has 20 problems. Since he uses a calculator to do his math homework, he will save 60 minutes per problem without a calculator. Since he uses a calculator to do 2 problems per minute, he will save 60 minutes / 2 problems = 30 minutes per problem.\n\nTo find out how many minutes it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator, we can divide the total number of minutes he saves (30 minutes) by the number of minutes he uses a calculator per problem (2).\n\n30 minutes / 2 problems per minute = 15 minutes per problem.\n\nSo, it takes Matt 15 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Matt does not need a calculator to solve the assignment. To do a problem without a calculator, he needs to complete it with the given amount of time. Since he is able to do 20 problems with a calculator in 2 minutes per problem, he can do 20 problems without a calculator in 4 minutes.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many minutes it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator.\n\nLet's start by using the information given: it takes Matt 2 minutes per problem to do his math homework with a calculator and 60 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.\n\nWe can set up a proportion to find the number of minutes it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator:\n\n2 minutes per problem * 20 problems = x minutes per problem\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n40 minutes per problem = x minutes per problem\n\nNow, we can find the number of minutes it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator:\n\nx minutes per problem = 40 minutes\nx = 40 minutes\n\nSo, it takes Matt 40 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Matt's homework assignment has 20 problems. He uses a calculator to do the math, but without a calculator, he saves 60 minutes.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\nMatt's calculator saves him 60 minutes. This means that for every problem, he saves 60 minutes.\n\nIf he does 1 problem without a calculator, he saves 60 minutes. Since there are 20 problems, he saves 60 minutes * 20 problems = 1200 minutes.\n\nSo, it takes Matt 1200 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Matt's assignment has 20 problems, and he uses a calculator to complete 60 minutes per problem. To find out how many minutes he spends without a calculator, we need to subtract the time spent using a calculator from the total time spent on the assignment.\n\nMatt uses a calculator for 60 minutes per problem, and he has 20 problems. So, he uses the calculator for 60/20 = 3 problems.\n\nMatt spends 3 minutes per problem without a calculator, and he has 20 problems. So, he spends 3 * 20 = 60 minutes without a calculator.\n\nThe total time spent without a calculator is 60 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it takes Matt 60 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Matt's assignment has 20 problems. Using a calculator will save him 60 minutes. \n\nSince Matt's assignment is done using a calculator, we can find the time it takes to do a problem without a calculator by subtracting the time it takes to do a problem with a calculator from the total time he needs to complete the assignment. \n\nMatt's assignment needs 20 problems, and he can complete the assignment using a calculator in 60 minutes. To find the time it takes to do a problem without a calculator, we subtract 60 minutes from the total time. \n\n20 problems * 60 minutes/problem = 1200 minutes.\n\nSo, it takes Matt 1200 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Matt takes 2 minutes per problem to do his math homework with a calculator and 60 minutes to do it without a calculator. We are also given that the assignment has 20 problems.\n\nNow, let's calculate the time it would take Matt to do a problem without a calculator. Since he takes 2 minutes per problem with a calculator, and the assignment has 20 problems, we can find the time it would take him to do 20 problems without a calculator by dividing the total number of problems by the time it takes him with a calculator:\n\n20 problems / 2 minutes per problem = 10 minutes without a calculator\n\nSo, it would take Matt 10 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Matt's assignment has 20 problems, and he uses a calculator to do most of the problems. To find out how long it takes him to do a problem without a calculator, we need to find out how many minutes it takes him to do 20 problems with a calculator.\n\nFirst, let's find out how long it takes him to do 20 problems with a calculator. Since he uses a calculator to do 20 problems with a calculator, and he uses a calculator for 2 minutes per problem, he uses a calculator for 20 * 2 = 40 minutes.\n\nNow, we want to find out how long it takes him to do 20 problems without a calculator. Since he uses a calculator for 40 minutes, he uses a calculator for 20 - 40 = -20 minutes without a calculator.\n\nSo, it takes Matt 20 - 20 = 0 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "To find out how many minutes it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator, we first need to determine the total amount of time it takes him to complete 20 problems with a calculator and 20 problems without a calculator.\n\nWhen Matt uses a calculator, he saves 60 minutes, so for 20 problems with a calculator, it takes him 20 * 60 = 1200 minutes.\n\nWhen Matt doesn't use a calculator, he takes 2 minutes per problem, so for 20 problems without a calculator, it takes him 20 * 2 = 40 minutes.\n\nNow, we can find out how many minutes it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator by subtracting the time it takes him with a calculator from the time it takes him without a calculator: 40 - 1200 = -9700 minutes.\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator, we should consider the negative answer to be the total time it takes him to do the 20 problems without a calculator. \n\nSo, it takes Matt 9700 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Matt spends 2 minutes per problem with a calculator, but this time is not directly related to the time it takes to solve a problem without a calculator. However, we can use the given information to make an educated guess.\n\nIf Matt spends 2 minutes per problem with a calculator, then the total time it takes to solve 20 problems with a calculator is 2 * 20 = 40 minutes.\n\nSince Matt's assignment has 20 problems, we can calculate the time it takes to solve a problem without a calculator by dividing the total number of problems by the time it takes to solve a problem with a calculator. This is because the time it takes to solve a problem without a calculator is directly proportional to the number of problems.\n\nTherefore, it takes Matt 40 / 2 = 20 minutes to solve a problem without a calculator.",
      "Matt takes 2 minutes per problem with a calculator, and he has 20 problems to complete. So, he spends 2 minutes per problem * 20 problems = 40 minutes per problem without a calculator.\n\nHowever, he saves 60 minutes by not using a calculator for the 20 problems without a calculator. So, he saves 60 minutes per problem - 40 minutes per problem without a calculator = 20 minutes per problem.\n\nTo find out how many minutes it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator, we divide the time he saves by the time it takes to complete a problem without a calculator.\n\nMatt saves 20 minutes per problem without a calculator, so it takes him 20 minutes per problem / 20 minutes per problem without a calculator = 1 problem without a calculator.\n\nTherefore, it takes Matt 1 problem without a calculator.",
