      "To find the bases of the trapezoid, we need to determine the relationship between $c$ and $d$. We can start by drawing a diagram of the trapezoid and labeling the bases as $c$ and $d$. Since the trapezoid is divided into two smaller trapezoids, the bases of the larger trapezoid are $c$ and $d$.\n\nNow, we can use the midpoint theorem to find the relationship between the bases. The midpoint theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length. Let's apply this theorem to the bases of the trapezoid.\n\nSince $c$ and $d$ are the bases of the trapezoid, the midpoint of $c$ and $d$ is the midpoint of $c$ and $d$. Let's call this midpoint $E$. We can now use the midpoint theorem to find the relationship between $c$ and $d$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{c+d}{2} &= \\frac{(c+d)}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{c+d}{2} &= \\frac{c+d}{2} \\\\\nc+d &= 2c \\\\\nd &= c \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the bases of the original trapezoid are equal to $c$ and $d$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the lateral sides of the trapezoid are equal to $c$ and $d$. Since $c$ is the side of the trapezoid, and $c$ and $d$ are the bases, we can write the lateral sides as:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2c &= d \\\\\n2d &= c \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince the lateral sides are equal, we can write the equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2c &= c \\\\\n2d &= c \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nc &= d \\\\\nc &= d \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the bases of the original trapezoid are equal to $c$ and $d$, and the sides of the trapezoid are $c$ and $d$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the lateral sides of the trapezoid are equal to $c$ and $d$. Since $c$ is the side of the trapezoid, and $c$ and $d$ are the bases, we can write the lateral sides as:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2c &= d \\\\\n2d &= c \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nc &= d \\\\\nc &= d \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the bases of the original trapezoid are equal to $c$ and $d$, and the sides of the trapezoid are $c$ and $d$.",

Let's denote the length of the slant side as $s$.\n\n$s = d - c - c$\n$s = d - 2c$\n\nStep 5: Find the length of the base\nThe base of a trapezoid can be found by adding the lengths of the two bases and then subtracting $d$ to account for the base. Let's denote the length of the base as $b_1$.\n\n$b_1 = c - d$\n\nStep 6: Find the final answer\nNow that we have the lengths of the lateral sides and the base, we can find the final answer.\n\nThe length of the lateral sides is $l = d - c$, the length of the base is $b_1 = c - d$, and the slant side is $s = d - 2c$.\n\nFinal answer: The bases of the original trapezoid are $c$ and $d$.",

      "To find the bases of the given right trapezoid, we can use the following reasoning:\n\nSince the line parallel to the bases of the trapezoid splits it into two smaller trapezoids, each of which can have a circle inscribed in it, we know that the distance between the parallel bases is equal to the height of the trapezoid.

We start by factoring the quadratic expression as y = -(x^2 - 2x) + m^2.\n\nWe can then complete the square by adding and subtracting the square of half the coefficient of x, which is (2/2)^2 = 1. This gives us y = -(x^2 - 2x + 1) + m^2.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get y = -(x - 1)^2 + m^2. Now we can take the square root of both sides to find the maximum value of the function.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get m^2 = -(x - 1)^2. To find the maximum value, we take the positive square root, since the maximum value is always positive.\n\nTherefore, m^2 = 1, and the maximum value of the function is m^2 = 1.

In this case, a = -1 and b = 2.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get x = -2 / (2 * -1) = 1. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the vertex is 1.\n\nNow, we can use the x-coordinate of the vertex to find the corresponding y-coordinate.

This can be simplified by factoring out the term -1, giving us -2 + m^2.\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of -2 + m^2. We can do this by taking the derivative of -2 + m^2 with respect to x, which gives us -2 + 2m.\n\nThe derivative is 2, so the critical point occurs when the derivative is equal to 0. This happens when -2 + 2m = 0, which gives us 2m = 2, so m = 1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the quadratic function y = -x^2 + 2x + m^2 is 3, which occurs when m = 1.\n\nThe maximum value of the function in the form \u00b1\u221avalue is \u221a3.",

Substituting this into the equation of the parabola, we get 0 = -(x - m^2 + 1)^2.\n\nDividing both sides by (-(x - m^2 + 1))^2, we get 0 = -x^2 - 2x - 1 + 2m^2. Simplifying this, we get 0 = -x^2 - 2x - 1 + 2m^2.\n\nAdding 2m^2 to both sides, we get 2m^2 = -x^2 - 2x - 1. Finally, dividing both sides by 2m^2, we get m^2 = -x^2 - 2x - 1/2.\n\nComparing this with the vertex form y = a(x - h)^2 + k, we can see that m^2 = 2x^2 - 4x - 1/2. Since the maximum value of the function is 3, we can set up the inequality 3 \u2265 2x^2 - 4x - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get 2x^2 - 4x - 1/2 \u2265 3. Adding 4x^2 to both sides, we get 2x^2 - 4x - 1 \u2265 10.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x^2 - 2x - 5 \u2265 5. Adding 5 to both sides, we get x^2 - 2x - 4 \u2265 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic inequality, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. Here, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -4.\n\nPlugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get x = (2 \u00b1 \u221a((-2)^2 - 4(1)(-4))) / 2(1). Simplifying, we get x = (2 \u00b1 \u221a(4 + 16)) / 2.\n\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a20) / 2. This gives us two possible values for x: x = (2 + \u221a20) / 2 and x = (2 - \u221a20) / 2.\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding y-values by substituting these x-values back into the original quadratic function. We get y = -((2 + \u221a20) / 2)^2 + (2 - \u221a20) / 2.\n\nSimplifying this, we get y = (-1 + \u221a20) / 4 + (-1 - \u221a20) / 4. Combining the fractions, we get y = (-1 + \u221a20 - 2\u221a20 + 2\u221a20) / 4.\n\nSimplifying, we get y = (-1 + 2\u221a20) / 4. Multiplying both sides by 4, we get y = -1 + 2\u221a20.\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function is -1 + 2\u221a20.",
      "To find the value of m, we need to analyze the given quadratic function y = -x^2 + 2x + m^2. Since the maximum value of the function is 3, we can set the function equal to 3 and solve for m.\n\ny = -x^2 + 2x + 3\n\nSubtract 2x from both sides to isolate the quadratic term:\n\ny = -x^2 + 2x + 3 - 2x\ny = -x^2 - 2x + 3\n\nNow, we need to find the vertex of the parabola defined by this function.

      "To find the maximum value of the quadratic function y = -x^2 + 2x + m^2, we can use the method of completing the square. Let's start by writing the quadratic function in vertex form: y = -(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola.\n\nWe can rewrite the given function in vertex form as y = -(x - h)^2 - k. Now, we can complete the square by adding and subtracting (b/2)^2, where b is the coefficient of the x term. In this case, b = 2.\n\nSo, we have y = -(x - h)^2 - (2/2)^2 + 2 + 3.

To do this, we can take the derivative of y with respect to x and set it equal to zero. The derivative of y = -x^2 + 2x + m^2 is y' = 2x - 2m.

      "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem states that the sum of the house numbers on one side of a street from corner to corner is 117. This means that the number of houses on one side of the street is 117, and we need to find the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section.\n\nStep 2: Set up the equation\nLet's denote the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section as x. Since the sum of the house numbers is 117, we can set up the equation x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + ... + (x + 9) = 117.\n\nStep 3: Simplify the equation\nNow, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms: x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + ... + (x + 9) = 117.\n\nStep 4: Continue simplifying\nWe can rewrite each set of parentheses as a sum: (x + 1) + (x + 2) + ... + (x + 9) = 5x + 10.\n\nStep 5: Solve for x\nNow, we need to isolate x. To do this, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 5x + 10 - 10 = 117 - 10, which gives us 5x = 117 - 10.\n\nStep 6: Solve for x\nNow, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 5: x = 117 - 10 / 5, which simplifies to x = 117 / 5.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the result\nx = 23.4\n\nStep 8: Round the result to the nearest tenth\nSince x is a decimal, we need to round it to the nearest tenth. We can do this by finding the nearest integer that is less than or equal to 23.4, which is 23.\n\nStep 9: Find the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section\nNow, we need to find the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section. Since the fifth house is the one that is 23.4 units away from the beginning of the street, the house number of the fifth house is 23.\n\nFinal Answer: The house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section is 23.",
      "Let's start by understanding the problem. We are given that the sum of the house numbers on one side of a street from corner to corner is 117. This means that the total number of houses on that side is 117.\n\nNow, we need to find the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section. Since we are given that the total number of houses on one side of the street is 117, we can set up a simple equation to represent this situation.\n\nLet's denote the house number of the fifth house as x. Since the total number of houses on one side of the street is 117, we can write the equation as:\n\nx + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4) + (x + 5) + (x + 6) + (x + 7) + (x + 8) + (x + 9) + (x + 10) + (x + 11) = 117\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n6x + 101 = 117\n\nNow, we need to isolate x. To do this, we can subtract 101 from both sides of the equation:\n\n6x = 117 - 101\n6x = 16\n\nFinally, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6 to find the value of x:\n\nx = 16 / 6\nx = 2.67\n\nSince the house number can only be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, the house number cannot be 117, as it is not a whole number. Therefore, the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section is 2.",
      "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given that the sum of the house numbers on one side of a street from corner to corner is 117. This means that the sum of the numbers from the corner to the first house is 117, and from the first house to the corner is also 117.\n\nStep 2: Set up the equation\nLet x be the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of the section. Then the sum of the house numbers from corner to corner is x + 117.\n\nStep 3: Solve the equation\nWe can set up the equation as x + 117 = 117, which simplifies to x = 17.\n\nStep 4: Find the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of the section\nSince we know that the sum of the house numbers from corner to corner is 117, we can use the equation x + 117 = 117 to find the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of the section.\n\nStep 5: Find the fifth house number\nThe fifth house number from the beginning of the section is 17.\n\nFinal answer: The house number of the fifth house from the beginning of the section is 17.",
      "To find the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of the section, we need to understand the problem. We know that the sum of the house numbers on one side of the street from corner to corner is 117. This means that the first house has a number of 117, the second house has a number of 118, and so on.\n\nSince the problem states that the sum of the house numbers is 117, we can set up an equation based on this information. Let's denote the house number of the fifth house as x. Then, according to the problem, the sum of the house numbers on one side of the street from corner to corner is 117, so we can write:\n\nx + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + ... + (x + 9) = 117\n\nWe can simplify this equation by combining like terms:\n\nx + (2x + 1) + (3x + 2) + ... + (11x + 10) = 117\n\nNow, let's factor out the common term (2x + 1) from the first few terms:\n\n(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) + ... + (x + 10) = 117\n\nNotice that the factors of 117 can be factored into pairs of numbers whose sum is 10. For example, the factor of 117 can be paired with the factor of 10 to get:\n\n2(55) + 10 = 117\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) + ... + (x + 10) = 117\n\nWe can now factor out the common factor of (x + 1) from each pair of terms:\n\nx(x + 2)(x + 3) + ... + (x + 10) = 117\n\nSince the factor of (x + 1) appears in each pair, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx(x + 2)(x + 3) + ... + (x + 10) = 117\n\nNow, we can see that the factors of (x + 1) appear in the first few terms, and they are also present in the last few terms. This means that the equation is symmetric.\n\nSince the factors of (x + 1) appear in the first few terms and the last few terms, we can conclude that the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of the section is x + 1.\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of x to find the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of the section:\n\nx + 1 = 5\n\nx = 4\n\nSo, the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of the section is 4."

      "To find the maximum value of $3a+b$, we can start by finding the expression inside the parentheses. We have $9a^{2}+b^{2}-6a-2b$. We can factor this expression as $(3a-b)(3a+b)=3a(3a-b)+b(3a+b)=3a(3a-b)+(3a+b)(3a+b)=3a(3a-b)+3a(3a+b)+3a(3a+b)-b(3a+b)=3a(3a-b)+3a(3a+b)+3a(3a+b)+b(3a+b)=3a(3a-b)+3a(3a+b)+3a(3a+b)+b(3a+b)=3a(3a-b)+3a(3a+b)+3a(3a+b)+2b(3a+b)=3a(3a-b)+3a(3a+b)+3a(3a+b)+2b(3a+b)=3a(3a-b)+3a(3a+b)+3a(3a+b)+2b(3a+b)$.\n\nNow we have two equations: $3a(3a-b)+3a(3a+b)+3a(3a+b)+2b(3a+b) = 3a(3a-b)+3a(3a+b)+3a(3a+b)+2b(3a+b) = 3a(3a-b)+3a(3a+b)+3a(3a+b)+2b(3a+b)$. Rearranging the terms, we get $3a(3a-b)+3a(3a+b)+3a(3a+b)+2b(3a+b)=0$.\n\nNow we can factor the left side of the equation as $(3a-b)(3a+b)=0$. This gives us two possible values for $3a-b$ and $3a+b$. We can choose any of these two values to represent the maximum value of $3a+b$.\n\nSo, the maximum value of $3a+b$ is $0$.\n\nFinal Answer: $0$",
      "To find the maximum value of $3a+b$, we can start by finding the vertex of the parabola defined by the equation $3a^{2}+b^{2}-6a-2b=0$. We can do this by completing the square.\n\nFirst, we can factor the quadratic expression as $(3a+b)^{2}=3a^{2}+b^{2}-6a-2b+6$. This gives us $(3a+b+2)^{2}=3a^{2}+b^{2}-6a-2b+6$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as $(3a+b+2)^{2}=3(a^{2}+b^{2}-6a+2b)+6$. Expanding the right-hand side gives us $(3a+b+2)^{2}=3(a^{2}+b^{2}-6a+2b)+6$.\n\nNext, we can factor the left-hand side as $(3a+b+2)(3a+b+2)=3(a^{2}+b^{2}-6a+2b)+6$. This gives us $(3a+b+2)(3a+b+2)=3(a^{2}+b^{2}-6a+2b)+6$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as $(3a+b+2)^{2}=3(a^{2}+b^{2}-6a+2b)+6$. Expanding the right-hand side gives us $(3a+b+2)^{2}=3(a^{2}+b^{2}-6a+2b)+6$.\n\nWe can now find the maximum value of $3a+b$ by solving the equation $(3a+b+2)^{2}=3(a^{2}+b^{2}-6a+2b)+6$. This gives us $(3a+b+2)^{2}=3(a^{2}+b^{2}-6a+2b)+6$.\n\nNow, we can solve the equation for $a^{2}+b^{2}$, and then find $a^{2}$ and $b^{2}$. We have $a^{2}+b^{2}=-6a+2b$. Subtracting $6a+2b$ from both sides gives us $a^{2}+b^{2}=-6$.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $a^{2}=-6$ and $b^{2}=-6$. Taking the square root of $-6$, we get $a^{2}=-3$ and $b^{2}=-3$.\n\nFinally, we can find $a$ and $b$ by taking the square root of $-3$ and $-3$, which gives us $a=-\\frac{3}{3}$ and $b=-\\frac{3}{3}$.\n\nNow, we can find the maximum value of $3a+b$ by plugging in the values of $a$ and $b$: $3a+b=3(-\\frac{3}{3})+b=-\\frac{9}{3}+b=-\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of $3a+b$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

      "To solve the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0, we need to find the values of x for which the left-hand side equals 0. We can start by noticing that the equation can be rewritten as 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 = 2^x - 2 - 1 - 1 = 2^x - 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x that make 2^x - 3 = 0. We can solve this equation by taking the logarithm of both sides. Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides gives us x = log2(2^x - 3).\n\nTo find the greatest integer less than or equal to x, we can use the fact that log2(x) is a continuous function. We can find the greatest integer less than or equal to x by taking the floor function, which is the nearest integer less than or equal to x.\n\nTherefore, the greatest integer less than or equal to x is floor(log2(2^x - 3)).\n\nNow, we can find the value of x that makes 2^x - 3 = 0 by using the fact that log2(2^x - 3) = x. Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides gives us x = log2(2^x - 3).\n\nFinally, we can find the value of x that makes 2^x - 3 = 0 by taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, which gives us x = floor(log2(2^x - 3)) = floor(log2(2^x - 3)).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is floor(log2(2^x - 3)).",
      "To solve the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0, we can start by expanding the left-hand side. This yields 2^x - 2x - 1 = 0.\n\nNow, let's factor the quadratic expression 2^x - 2x - 1. We notice that 2^x - 2x can be factored as (2x - 1)(2^x + 1), which is the product of two binomials. This factorization allows us to rewrite the equation as (2x - 1)(2^x + 1) = 0.\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation (2x - 1)(2^x + 1) = 0. This equation can be factored further, but it's not immediately clear how to proceed. However, we can try to find a pattern.\n\nNotice that 2^x + 1 is always greater than or equal to 2x - 1. This means that if we set 2^x - 2x - 1 = 0, we can rewrite the equation as 2^x - 2x - (2x - 1) = 0, which simplifies to 2x - 2x - 1 = 0.\n\nNow, we can see that the equation 2x - 2x - 1 = 0 has a common factor of 2x - 1.

Solving for x, we find that x = -1.\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 are x = -1 and x = 1, but we need to express the final answer as a single integer.

However, we need to account for the possibility of fractional solutions as well.\n\nTo find the fractional solutions, we can use the fact that the binomial theorem expansion of 2^x - 4x - 1 is a sum of terms, each term being of the form ax + bx^(n-1) + cx^(n-2) + ... where a, b, c, ..., are integers.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n2^x - 4x - 1 = 2^x - 4x + 1 - 2x - 1 + 1\n= 2^x - 4x + 1 + 2x\n\nNow, we can expand the right-hand side of the equation:\n2^x - 4x + 1 + 2x = 2^x - 4x + 3x + 1\n\nThe greatest integer less than or equal to 2^x is 2^x - 1, so we can write:\n2^x - 4x + 3x + 1 = 2^x - 4x + 1 + 2x\n= 2^x - 4x + 3x + 2x + 1\n= 2^x - 5x + 1\n\nNow, we can find the greatest integer less than or equal to 2^x by finding the largest integer less than or equal to 2^x.

This allows us to rewrite the equation as 2^(x+1) - 2^x - 1 = 0.\n\nNow, we can factor the left-hand side by looking for a pattern.

      "To find the number of solutions to the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0, we can start by looking at the behavior of the expression inside the square root. \n\nThe expression inside the square root is a polynomial, so it can be factored into the product of linear factors. We can rewrite 2^x as (2 + 1)^x and then expand it to get 2^x = (2 + 1)^x * e^(x*ln(2)), where e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nNext, we can rewrite the equation as 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = (2 + 1)^x * e^(x*ln(2)) - 1. \n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by canceling out the common factor 2 from the two terms on the right-hand side. This gives us 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = (2 + 1)^x * e^(x*ln(2)).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as (2 + 1)^x * e^(x*ln(2)) - 1 = 0. \n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by e^(x*ln(2)), which is the common factor on the right-hand side.

This occurs when the function has a local extremum (a minimum or maximum), and the function's behavior changes.\n\nIn this case, the function is a linear function, but it can be rewritten as f(x) = 2^x - 2[x] - 1. The function is continuous and differentiable for all real numbers x.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 as a quadratic equation in terms of the greatest integer less than or equal to the real number x. This is because the function has a local extremum at x = [x], where [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x.\n\nWe can solve the quadratic equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 by factoring. Letting y = 2^x - 2[x] - 1, we have y = 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0. Factoring, we get (2^x - 2[x])(y + 1) = 0.\n\nThis equation has two real solutions: y = 2^x - 2[x] and y + 1 = 0.

      "To solve this problem, we need to consider the rate at which the tank is being filled and the rate at which the tank is being emptied. We also need to account for the fact that there's a leak in the bottom of the tank.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the rate at which the tank is being filled by Inlet Pipe A. Since the tank is full when the two pipes are opened simultaneously, we can assume that the tank has been full for a while before the pipes were opened.\n\nInlet Pipe A fills the tank at a rate of 6 litres per minute. Since the tank is full when the two pipes are opened, we can calculate the time it takes for the tank to be full by dividing the time it takes to fill the tank (3 hours) by the rate at which the tank is being filled (6 litres per minute).\n\nTime to fill the tank = 3 hours / 6 litres per hour = 1/2 hour.\n\nNow, let's consider the rate at which the tank is being emptied by Inlet Pipe B. Since the tank is empty when the two pipes are opened, we can assume that the tank has been empty for a while before the pipes were opened.\n\nInlet Pipe B empties the tank at a rate of 4 litres per minute. Since the tank is empty when the two pipes are opened, we can calculate the time it takes for the tank to be empty by dividing the time it takes to empty the tank (12 hours) by the rate at which the tank is being emptied (4 litres per minute).\n\nTime to empty the tank = 12 hours / 4 litres per hour = 3 hours.\n\nNow, let's consider the leak in the tank. When the leak is full, the tank is empty, so we need to find out how much time it takes for the leak to empty the tank.\n\nInlet Pipe A fills the tank at a rate of 6 litres per minute. When the tank is full, the rate at which the tank is being filled (6 litres per minute) is equal to the rate at which the leak empties the tank (12 litres per hour).\n\nInlet Pipe A fills the tank = 6 litres per minute. Inlet Pipe A fills the tank in 12 hours.\n\nInlet Pipe A fills the tank = 6 litres per minute * 12 hours = 72 litres per hour.\n\nInlet Pipe B empties the tank at a rate of 4 litres per minute. When the tank is full, the rate at which the tank is being emptied (4 litres per minute) is equal to the rate at which the leak empties the tank (12 litres per hour).\n\nInlet Pipe B empties the tank = 4 litres per minute. Inlet Pipe B empties the tank in 12 hours.\n\nNow, let's combine the times it takes for the tank to be filled and emptied.\n\nTime to fill the tank = 1/2 hour (filling) + 3 hours (emptying) = 4 hours.\n\nTime to empty the tank = 3 hours (emptying) + 12 hours (full) = 15 hours.\n\nSo, the tank can hold 72 litres of water when it's full, and 120 litres of water when it's empty.",
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We know that the leak in the bottom of the tank can empty the full tank in 3 hours. This means the tank is full in 1 hour, and the leak will empty it in 3/12 = 1/4 hour.\n\n2. We also know that both inlet pipes can fill the tank. The rate of filling can be calculated by dividing the rate of filling by the rate of emptying. So, the rate of filling per hour is 6 litres / 1/4 hour = 120 litres per hour.\n\n3. Now, we need to find out how many litres the tank can hold in 1 hour. We know the rate of filling is 120 litres per hour, so the rate of filling per minute is 120 litres / 60 minutes = 2 litres per minute.\n\n4. To find out how many litres the tank can hold in 12 hours, we need to calculate the rate of filling per hour and then multiply it by the number of hours. So, the rate of filling per hour is 2 litres / 1 hour.\n\n5. Now, we need to find out how many litres the tank can hold in 1 hour. We know that the rate of filling is 2 litres per hour, so the rate of filling per minute is 2 litres / 60 minutes = 1/10 litres per minute.\n\n6. Now, we can calculate how many litres the tank can hold in 12 hours. We know the rate of filling is 1/10 litres per minute, so the rate of filling per hour is 1/10 litres / 12 hours = 1/240 litres per hour.\n\n7. We are given that the tank is empty in 12 hours. We can set up the equation 1/240 litres per hour = 1/4 hour. This simplifies to 1/240 = 1/4. So, 1/240 = 1/4, which means 240 = 4.\n\n8. Therefore, the tank can hold 240 litres.\n\nFinal answer: The tank can hold 240 litres.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to consider the rate at which the tank is being filled and the rate at which the tank is being emptied due to the leak.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much water is being added to the tank through Inlet Pipe A and Inlet Pipe B simultaneously.\n\nInlet Pipe A fills 6 litres per minute, and Inlet Pipe B fills 4 litres per minute. If both pipes are opened simultaneously, the total rate at which water is being added to the tank is 6 + 4 = 10 litres per minute.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much water is being removed from the tank due to the leak. The leak can empty the tank in 12 hours, so we need to find out how much water is being removed at this rate.\n\nWe know that the tank is empty after 12 hours, and the rate at which water is being added is 10 litres per minute. Therefore, the rate at which water is being removed from the tank is 10 - 10 * 12 = 10 - 120 = -100 litres per hour.\n\nNow, let's find out how much water is being removed per minute. Since the leak is removing 100 litres per hour, the rate at which water is being removed per minute is 100 / 60 = 1.67 litres per minute.\n\nWe also know that the tank is empty after 12 hours, and the rate at which water is being added is 10 litres per minute. Therefore, the rate at which water is being added per minute is 10 + 100 / 60 = 10 + 1.67 = 11.67 litres per minute.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the rate at which water is being added per minute: 10 + 1.67 = 11.67.\n\nHowever, we can also use the formula for the rate at which water is being removed per minute: 10 - 1.67 = 8.33.\n\nSince the rate at which water is being added is 10 + 1.67, and the rate at which water is being removed is 8.33, we can set up the equation: 10 + 1.67 = 8.33.\n\nSolving for x, we get: 11.67 = 8.33.\n\nThis means that the rate at which water is being removed per minute is 8.33 / 11.67 = 0.7143.\n\nWe can use the formula for the rate at which water is being added per minute: 11.67 + 0.7143 = 12.3843.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation: 11.67 + 0.7143 = 12.3843.\n\nSolving for x, we get: 11.67 = 12.3843.\n\nThis means that the rate at which water is being added per minute is 12.3843 / 11.67 = 1.02.\n\nFinally, we can use the formula for the rate at which water is being removed per minute: 12.3843 - 1.02 = 11.3621.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation: 11.67 + 1.02 = 11.3621.\n\nSolving for x, we get: 11.67 = 11.3621.\n\nThis means that the rate at which water is being removed per minute is 11.3621 / 11.67 = 0.9964.\n\nWe can use the formula for the rate at which water is being added per minute: 12.3843 + 0.9964 = 13.3707.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation: 12.3843 + 0.9964 = 13.3707.\n\nSolving for x, we get: 13.3707 = 13.3707.\n\nThis means that the rate at which water is being added per minute is 13.3707 / 13.3707 = 1.03.\n\nFinally, we can use"

      "To find the value of $m$, we can start by using the fact that the line $x+y-m=0$ is perpendicular to the line $x+(3-2m)y=0$. This means that the slopes of the two lines are negative reciprocals of each other.\n\nLet's denote the slope of the line $x+(3-2m)y=0$ as $m'$. We can write the equation of this line as:\n\n$y = (3-2m')x$\n\nNow, the equation of a line perpendicular to this line is the reflection of $y = (3-2m')x$ across the line $x+y-m=0$. This means that the slope of the reflection line is the negative reciprocal of $m'$. So, the slope of the reflection line is:\n\n$y' = (-1/m')x$\n\nTo find the value of $m$, we can set up the equation:\n\n$y' = (-1/m')x$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $y'$ from the equation of the original line, we get:\n\n$(-1/m')x = (3-2m')x$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $m'$, we get:\n\n$m'x = (3-2m')m'$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$m' = 3-2m$\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $m'$ into the equation of the original line:\n\n$x+y-m = 0$\n\n$x+y-3-2m = 0$\n\n$x+y-m-3-2m = 0$\n\n$(x-3)^2 + (y-m)^2 = 0$\n\nThis is the equation of the line perpendicular to the original line. Comparing this with the equation of the line $x+(3-2m)y=0$, we can see that the slope of the perpendicular line is $m' = \\frac{3-2m}{1}$.\n\nSince $m' = \\frac{3-2m}{1}$, we can find the value of $m$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $1$. This gives us:\n\n$m = \\frac{3-2m}{1} = \\frac{3}{1} - \\frac{2m}{1} = \\frac{3-2m}{1} = \\frac{3-2m}{1} = \\frac{3-2m}{1} = \\frac{3-2m}{1} = \\frac{3-2m}{1} = \\frac{3-2m}{1} = \\frac{3-2m}{1}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$m = 3-2m$\n\nSo, the value of the real number $m$ is $3-2m$.",

      "Step 1: Determine the slope of the given line.\nWe start by writing the equation of the given line in slope-intercept form, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope. Rearranging the equation, we get $y=mx-b/m$. Comparing this with the equation of the line $x+y-m=0$, we have $m=0$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the slope of the perpendicular line.\nSince the line $x+y-m=0$ is perpendicular to the line $x+(3-2m)y=0$, the slope of the perpendicular line will be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. The negative reciprocal of $m$ is $\\frac{-1}{m}$.\n\nStep 3: Determine the value of $m$.\nNow that we have the slopes of the two lines, we can use the point-slope form of a line to find the point where the two lines intersect. The point-slope form is $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point on the line, and $m$ is the slope. Plugging in the values we have, we get $y-(-3-2m)=0$. Simplifying, we get $y+2m=0$. Subtracting $2m$ from both sides, we get $y=2m$.\n\nStep 4: Find the value of $m$.\nFinally, we can find the value of $m$ by substituting the expression for $y$ into the original equation of the line. Rearranging the equation, we get $2m=0$. Dividing both sides by $2$, we get $m=0$.\n\nFinal answer: The value of $m$ is 0.",
      "To solve this problem, we first need to find the equation of the line perpendicular to the line $x+(3-2m)y=0$. We can do this by finding the slope of the original line.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation of the original line as $y=x+m$. Then, we can find the slope of the original line by finding the derivative of the equation of the line. The derivative of $y=x+m$ with respect to $x$ is $\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{d(x+m)}{dx}=m$. Therefore, the slope of the original line is $m$.\n\nNext, we need to find the slope of the line perpendicular to the original line. The slope of a line perpendicular to another line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the original line. Therefore, the slope of the line perpendicular to $x+(3-2m)y=0$ is $\\frac{-1}{m}$.\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the line perpendicular to the original line. The point-slope form is $y-y_0=m(x-x_0)$, where $(x_0,y_0)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope.\n\nWe can use the point $(1,m)$ from the original line to find the slope of the perpendicular line. So, we have $m=(1-m)$. Then, the equation of the perpendicular line is $y-m=m(x-1)$.\n\nNow, we can substitute the point $(1,m)$ from the original line into the equation of the perpendicular line to find the value of $m$. So, we have $m=(1-m)=(1-m)(1-1)=0$.\n\nTherefore, the value of the real number $m$ is $0$.",

The bag is 5 meters long, and we want to find its weight in kilograms. Since there are 1000 kilograms in a metric ton (or 1000 grams), we can convert 5 meters to 5000 grams. So, the weight of the bag in kilograms is 5000 grams / 1000 = 5 kilograms.\n\nNext, we need to find the weight of the chair in kilograms. The chair is 4 meters long, and we want to find its weight in kilograms. Since there are 1000 kilograms in a metric ton (or 1000 grams), we can convert 4 meters to 4000 grams. So, the weight of the chair in kilograms is 4000 grams / 1000 = 4 kilograms.\n\nNow that we have the weights of the bag and chair, we can find their combined weight in kilograms. The combined weight is the sum of their individual weights: 5 kilograms (bag) + 4 kilograms (chair) = 9 kilograms.\n\nSo, the combined weight of the bag and chair is 9 kilograms.",
      "First, let's determine the weight of the bag and chair individually. The bag has a length of 5 meters and a weight of 29/8 kilograms, which is approximately 3.27 kilograms. The chair has a length of 4 meters and a weight of 2.8 kilograms, which is approximately 2.8 kilograms.\n\nNow, let's combine these weights to find the total weight of both the bag and chair. We add the weights of the bag and the chair: 3.27 kilograms (bag) + 2.8 kilograms (chair) = 5.07 kilograms.\n\nNext, we need to find the combined length of the bag and chair. Since the bag and chair are 2 meters (m) long and the weight is in kilograms, we can multiply the weight by 2 to find the combined length. 5.07 kilograms (total weight) * 2 meters (length) = 10.14 meters (combined length).\n\nNow that we have the combined length, we can find the total weight of the bag and chair by multiplying the combined length by the weight of the bag and chair. 10.14 meters (combined length) * 3.27 kilograms (weight) = 35.79 kilograms (total weight).\n\nSo, the combined weight of the bag and chair is 35.79 kilograms.",
      "To determine the combined weight of the bag and chair, we need to calculate the weight of the combined items. \n\nThe bag is 5 meters long, so its weight is 5 meters * 29/8 kilograms/meter = 142.5 kilograms (142.5 kg).\n\nThe chair is 4 meters long, so its weight is 4 meters * 2.8 kilograms/meter = 11.2 kilograms (11.2 kg).\n\nThe combined weight of the bag and chair is 142.5 kilograms + 11.2 kilograms = 153.7 kilograms (153.7 kg).\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of the bag and chair is 153.7 kilograms.",
      "To solve this problem, let's first calculate the weight of the chair in kilograms (kg). Since the chair is 4 meters long, its length is 4 m. The weight of the chair is given as 2.8 kg, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n2.8 kg = (4 m * 29/8 kg) / (2 m * 1 kg/m)\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can cancel out the m terms:\n\n2.8 kg = (4 m * 29/8 kg) / (2 m * 1 kg/m)\n2.8 kg = (4 * 29/8 kg) / 2 kg\n2.8 kg = (147/8 kg) / 2 kg\n\nNow we can solve for the weight of the chair:\n\n2.8 kg = 147/8 kg\n2.8 kg * 8/147 = 147/8 kg\n14.7 kg = 147/8 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the weight of the bag by adding the weight of the chair to the weight of the bag:\n\n14.7 kg + 29/8 kg = 14.7 kg + (29/8 kg)\n14.7 kg = 24.5 kg\n\nSo, the weight of the bag is 24.5 kg.",
      "Step 1: Find the weight of the chair in kilograms (kg)\nWe know the weight of the chair is 2.8 kilograms (kg).\n\nStep 2: Find the weight of the bag in kilograms (kg)\nThe weight of the bag is 5 meters (m) long, so we can subtract the weight of the chair from the total length to find the weight of the bag:\n\nWeight of the bag = Total length - Weight of the chair\nWeight of the bag = 5m - 2.8m\nWeight of the bag = 22.2m\n\nStep 3: Find the weight of the chair and the bag together\nNow we need to find the total weight of the chair and the bag together. We can multiply the weight of the chair by 2 and the weight of the bag by 2:\n\nTotal weight = 2 times the weight of the chair + 2 times the weight of the bag\nTotal weight = 2 * 2.8 + 2 * 5\nTotal weight = 5.6 + 10\nTotal weight = 15.6\n\nStep 4: Find the weight of the bag and the chair together\nWe can now subtract the total weight of the bag and the chair from the total weight to find the weight of the bag and the chair:\n\nWeight of the bag and chair = Total weight - Total weight of the bag and chair\nWeight of the bag and chair = 15.6 - 15.6\nWeight of the bag and chair = 0\n\nSo, the weight of the bag and the chair is 0 kilograms (kg)."

The box has dimensions $10 \\times 10 \\times 1$, so the volume is $10^3$. The balls need to be placed in such a way that their combined volume is less than or equal to the volume of the box.\n\nTo achieve this, the balls should be arranged in a way that the largest possible spheres can fit inside the box.

The original price is 100% of the profit, which is 100% * 0.60 = 60.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the trader bought the car at a discount to find the original price. The discount is 100% of the original price, which is 100% * 60 = 60.\n\nTherefore, the original price of the car is 60.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the original price of the car: The problem states that the trader bought the car at a certain discount on its original price. We can represent this as an equation:\n\nPrice at the start = (Discount + Original Price) * 100\n\nIn this case, the Discount is 100% (100), and the Original Price is 100% (100). So, the equation becomes:\n\nPrice at the start = (100 + 100) * 100\nPrice at the start = 200 * 100\nPrice at the start = 20,000\n\n2. Calculate the profit made on the original price: The profit made on the original price is calculated as follows:\n\nProfit = (Original Price - Price at the start)\nProfit = 100 - 200\nProfit = -100\n\n3. Calculate the percentage increase on the original price: To find the percentage increase, we need to calculate the increase and divide it by the original price. The increase is 100% (Discount), and the original price is 20000. So, the percentage increase is:\n\nPercentage increase = (Increase / Original Price) * 100\nPercentage increase = (100 / 20000) * 100\nPercentage increase = 0.05 * 100\nPercentage increase = 5%\n\n4. Calculate the discount percentage on the original price: To find the percentage discount, we need to divide the profit by the original price. The profit is -100, and the original price is 20000. So, the percentage discount is:\n\nPercentage discount = (Profit / Original Price) * 100\nPercentage discount = ((-100) / 20000) * 100\nPercentage discount = -5%\n\nTherefore, the discount percentage on the original price when the trader bought the car was -5%.",
      "To find the discount percentage, we first need to calculate the original price. We know that the trader bought the car at a 100% increase on its original price, which means he bought it at the original price plus 100% of the original price.\n\nLet's denote the original price as x. The 100% increase means the trader bought the car at x + 100% of x, which is x + 100x. To simplify this, we can rewrite it as x(1 + 100/x).\n\nThe profit made on the car is 60,000,000,000,000,000 / 100 = 6,000,000,000. So, the profit is 6,000,000,000 / x.\n\nWe can set up the equation: x(1 + 100/x) = 6,000,000,000 / 100.\n\nNow, we can solve for x. Multiply both sides by x: x^2 + 100x = 60,000,000,000.\n\nSubtract 60,000,000,000 from both sides: x^2 + 100x - 60,000,000,000 = 0.\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation: (x + 60,000,000,000)(x - 100) = 0.\n\nThis equation has two solutions: x = -60,000,000,000 or x = 100.\n\nSince x is the original price, it cannot be negative. Therefore, the only possible value for x is x = 100.\n\nThe original price is 100. Now, we can find the discount percentage. The discount is the difference between the original price and the profit: 100 - 60,000,000,000 / 100 = 500,000,000,000 / 100 = 500,000,000.\n\nThe discount percentage is 500,000,000 / 100 = 500,000.\n\nThe discount percentage is 500,000.",

Substituting this into the equation, we get 2(1/\u221a2)cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(3a) - 2(1/\u221a2)cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(2a) = 2(1/\u221a2)cos(3a)cos(2x).\n\nThis simplifies to 2(cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(2a)) - 2(cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(2a)) = 2(1/\u221a2)cos(3a)cos(2x).\n\nNow, we can rewrite this equation as 2(cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(2a)) - 2(cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(2a)) = 2(1/\u221a2)cos(3a)cos(2x).\n\nWe can further simplify this equation by recognizing that cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(2a) = cos(3x + 2a)cos(2x)cos(2a). Substituting this into the equation, we get 2(cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(2a)) - 2(cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(2a)) = 2(1/\u221a2)cos(3a)cos(2x).\n\nThis simplifies to 2(cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(2a)) - 2(cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(2a)) = 2(1/\u221a2)cos(3a)cos(2x).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as 2(cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(2a)) = 2(1/\u221a2)cos(3a)cos(2x).\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(2a) = cos(3a)cos(2x).\n\nNow, we can find the value of a \u2208 (0, \u03c0) such that cos(3a) = cos(\u03c0) using the angle addition formula. We know that cos(\u03c0) = -1.\n\nThis implies that 3a = 2k\u03c0, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(2a) = cos(3a)cos(2x).\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get cos(3x)cos(2x)cos(2a) = cos(3a)cos(2x).\n\nWe can rewrite cos(3a)cos(2x) as cos",

Initially, his total savings was $2750. After investing in the compound interest bond, his total savings became $2750 + $550 = $3200.\n\nTo find the interest received from the compound interest bond, we need to subtract the interest earned from the initial investment from the final value of his total savings. So, the interest received from the compound interest bond is $3200 - $3000 = $200.\n\nTherefore, Shawn received $200 from the compound interest bond.",

The total interest earned is the sum of the interest earned from the bond that pays simple interest and the interest earned from the bond that pays compound interest.\n\nThe total interest earned is $275 (from the simple interest bond) + $275 (from the compound interest bond) = $550.\n\nSo, Shawn received $550 in interest from the compound interest bond.",
      "First, let's find the value of the bond that paid simple interest for 2 years. The interest is given as $550, and the total value of the bond for 2 years is $2750.

The interest is given as $550, and the total value of the bond for 2 years is $2750. So, the interest earned is $550 / 2 = $275.\n\nNow, we can find the interest earned from the compound interest bond by subtracting the interest earned from the bond that paid simple interest from the total value of the compound interest bond. The compound interest bond has an interest rate of $275 / 2 = $137.50, and the total value is $2750. So, the interest earned from the compound interest bond is $137.50 - $275 = -$152.50.\n\nHowever, we are given that the value of the compound interest bond is $550, not $-$152.50. Therefore, the value of the compound interest bond is $550.\n\nNow, we can find the total value of the bond that paid compound interest for the same 2 years by adding the interest earned from the compound interest bond and the interest earned from the bond that paid simple interest. The compound interest bond has an interest rate of $137.50, and the total value is $2750.

In a Cartesian coordinate system, a point is represented by an ordered pair (x, y), where x is the horizontal axis and y is the vertical axis.\n\nWhen a car travels 5 kilometers to the east, its position can be represented by an ordered pair (x, y) = (x, 0). This means that the car's horizontal distance from the origin is 5 units to the east, and its vertical distance is 0 units.\n\nNow, when the car travels 5 kilometers to the west, its position can be represented by an ordered pair (x, y) = (x, y - 5). This means that the car's horizontal distance from the origin is 5 units to the west, and its vertical distance is 0 units.\n\nTo find the final position of the car, we need to add the distance traveled in the east direction to the distance traveled in the west direction.

      "To find the percentage increase in the price of gasoline, we first need to determine the original price of gasoline and the new price after the 10% increase.\n\nLet's start with the original price. Let's denote the original price of gasoline as x.\n\nWhen the price of gasoline increases by 10%, the new price becomes x + (10% of x) = x + 0.1x = x + 0.1x = x + 0.1x = 1.1x.\n\nNow, if the driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline, the new price after the 10% increase is 1.1x + 0.1x = 1.2x.\n\nTo find the percentage increase, we compare the new price to the original price. The new price is 1.2x, and the original price is x. To find the percentage increase, we subtract the original price from the new price and divide by the original price: (1.2x - x) / x = 0.1x = 10%.\n\nSo, the percentage increase in the price of gasoline is 10%.",

      "To solve this problem, let's first understand the given information. The price of gasoline increases by a certain percentage, and the driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline. This means that the price of gasoline will increase by the same percentage as the driver's desired increase.\n\nLet's denote the original price of gasoline as x. The driver's desired increase is 10% more than the original price, which means the desired increase is x + 0.10x = 1.1x.\n\nThe driver wants to spend only 10% more on gasoline, so he should reduce the quantity of gasoline that he buys by 12%. This means that the new quantity of gasoline should be x - 12%.\n\nWe can set up the equation to represent this situation:\n\n(x + 0.1x) - 12 = 1.1x - 12\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1.1x - 12 = 1.1x - 12\n\nNow, add 12 to both sides of the equation:\n\n1.2x - 12 = 0\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n1.2x = 12\n\nDivide both sides by 1.2:\n\nx = 12/1.2\n\nx = 10\n\nNow that we know the original price of gasoline is x = 10, we can find the new price of gasoline when the driver increases it by 10%:\n\nNew price = x + 10% of x\nNew price = 10 + 0.10x\n\nTo find the percentage increase in the price of gasoline, we can divide the new price by the original price:\n\nPercentage increase = (New price - Original price) / Original price\n= (10 + 10% of 10) / 10\n= (10 + 10 + 100/100) / 10\n= 110/10\n= 11\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase in the price of gasoline is 11%.",

Subtract 0.1P from both sides to get:\n\nP = 100% + 10% - 0.1P\n\n4. Now, let's find the price of gasoline after the increase:\n\nP + 10% of P = 100% + 10%\n\n5. Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 100:\n\nP + 10 + 10% of P = 100\n\n6. Now, subtract 10% of P from both sides:\n\nP + 10% of P - 10% of P = 100 - 10%\n\n7. Simplify the equation by combining the 10% terms:\n\nP + 90% of P = 90%\n\n8. Now, divide both sides by 90% to get:\n\nP = 90% / 90%\n\n9. Now, divide both sides by 9% to get:\n\nP = 10\n\n10. Since P = 10, we can find the price of gasoline after the increase by dividing it by 10:\n\nP = 10 / 10\n\n11. Simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n\nP = 5\n\nSo, the price of gasoline after the increase is 5 dollars.

Therefore, the price after the increase is 100% + 10% = 110%.\n\nNow, let's calculate the quantity of gasoline that the driver will buy if the price increases by 110%. The driver buys x units of gasoline, so the quantity before the increase is x * 110% = 110x.\n\nThe driver wants to spend only 10% more on gasoline, so the original quantity of gasoline is x * 100% = 100x.

      "Step 1: Determine the original price of gasoline.\nLet's denote the original price of gasoline as x.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the new price of gasoline.\nSince the driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline, the new price will be x + (x * 10/100) = x + x = 1.1x.\n\nStep 3: Determine the new quantity of gasoline.\nThe driver wants to reduce the quantity of gasoline by 12%, so he should buy 12/100 * 1.1x = 0.12x gasoline.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the price of gasoline after buying gasoline.\nThe price of gasoline after buying gasoline is the original price x + 0.12x = 1.2x.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the percentage increase in the price of gasoline.\nThe percentage increase in the price of gasoline is ((1.2x - x) / x) * 100 = (0.1x / x) * 100 = 10%.\n\nSo, the driver should reduce the quantity of gasoline that he buys by 12%, resulting in a price increase of 10%.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and then apply it to the given scenario.\n\nGiven:\n- The price of gasoline increases by a certain percentage.\n- The driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline.\n- The driver should reduce the quantity of gasoline that he buys by 12%.\n\nStep 1: Find the original price of gasoline.\nWe are given that the price of gasoline increases by a certain percentage. Let's denote the original price of gasoline as 'x'.\n\nStep 2: Find the new price of gasoline.\nThe driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline, which means that the new price of gasoline is 'x + 0.10x' (since the 10% increase is applied to the original price).\n\nStep 3: Find the new quantity of gasoline to be bought.\nSince the driver should reduce the quantity of gasoline that he buys by 12%, the new quantity of gasoline to be bought is 'x - 12'.\n\nStep 4: Find the percentage increase in the price of gasoline.\nTo find the percentage increase in the price of gasoline, we need to find the difference between the new price and the original price.\n\nStep 5: Apply the percentage increase to the price of gasoline.\nThe percentage increase in the price of gasoline is ((x + 0.10x) - x) * 100 / x = (1.10x - x) * 100 / x = 0.10x * 100 / x = 10%.\n\nSo, the percentage increase in the price of gasoline is 10%.",

To find the new price of gasoline, we can use the formula:\n\nNew price = Old price + (New price - Old price) * (1 + Percentage increase)\n\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\n\nNew price = Old price + (New price - Old price) * (1 + 10%)\n\nWe can simplify the equation by first finding the price of gasoline after the 10% increase:\n\nNew price = Old price + (10% of Old price) * (1 + 10%)\nNew price = Old price + (10% of Old price) * (1 + 0.1)\nNew price = Old price + (10% of Old price) * 1.1\nNew price = Old price + (10% of Old price) * 1.1\n\nNew price = Old price + (10% of Old price)\n\nNow, we can find the price of gasoline after the 10% increase by dividing the new price by the old price:\n\nPrice after 10% increase = New price / Old price\nPrice after 10% increase = (1.1 * Old price) / Old price\nPrice after 10% increase = 1.1 * Old price\n\nNext, we need to find the percentage increase in the price of gasoline by subtracting the price of gasoline after the 10% increase from the price of gasoline before the 10% increase:\n\nPercentage increase = ((Price after 10% increase) - (Price before 10% increase)) / Price before 10% increase\nPercentage increase = ((1.1 * Old price) - (Old price)) / Old price\nPercentage increase = (1.1 - 1.1 * Old price) / Old price\n\nNow, we can find the percentage increase by dividing the percentage increase by the original price and multiplying by 100:\n\nPercentage increase = ((1.1 - 1.1 * Old price) / Old price) * 100\nPercentage increase = (0.1 - 1.1 * Old price) / Old price * 100\n\nNow, we can find the percentage increase by dividing the percentage increase by the original price and multiplying by 100:\n\nPercentage increase = ((Percentage increase / 100) * 100)\nPercentage increase = (0.1 - 0.1 * 100) / 100\nPercentage increase = (0.01 - 100) / 100\nPercentage increase = -99.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase in the price of gasoline is -99.9%.",

The percentage increase in the price of gasoline is:\n\n(New price - Original price) / Original price = (120 - 100) / 100 = 20%\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage increase in the quantity of gasoline that the driver should reduce.

      "To find the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points, we need to find the z-scores for 80 and 90 points, and then use the standard normal distribution table to find the corresponding probabilities.\n\nFirst, we calculate the z-scores for 80 and 90 points:\n\nz-score for 80 = (80 - 80) / 100 = 0\nz-score for 90 = (90 - 80) / 100 = 0.5\n\nNow, we use the standard normal distribution table to find the probabilities:\n\nP(Z \u2264 0) = 0.5\nP(Z \u2264 0.5) = 0.6931 (using a standard normal distribution table)\n\nSince we want the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points, we need to find the area between z = 0 and z = 0.5. This area is equal to P(Z \u2264 0.5) - P(Z \u2264 0).\n\nP(Z \u2264 0.5) = 0.6931 - 0.5 = 0.1931\n\nNow, we can find the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points by multiplying the area by the total number of students:\n\nNumber of students = P(Z \u2264 0.5) * Total number of students\n= 0.1931 * 48\n= 8.95\n\nSo, approximately 8.95 students in the class scored between 80 and 90 points.",
      "To find the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points, we need to calculate the z-scores for these values.\n\nThe z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations away from the mean a value is. For a test score of 80, the z-score is:\n\nz = (80 - 80) / 100 = 0\n\nFor a test score of 90, the z-score is:\n\nz = (90 - 80) / 100 = 1\n\nNow, we can find the area between the z-scores of 0 and 1, which corresponds to the area to the left of 80 and to the left of 90. This area is approximately 0.6827 (or 68.27%).\n\nSince the number of students is theoretical and the distribution is normal, we can use the 68-95-99.7 rule, also known as the empirical rule. This rule states that in a normal distribution:\n\n- About 68% of the data points fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean.\n- About 95% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.\n- About 99.7% of the data points fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n- About 68% of the students scored between 80 and 90 points (i.e., within 1 standard deviation of the mean).\n\nSo, the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points is approximately 68%.",

      "Step 1: Completing the square for the given quadratic equation $x^{2}-2x+m=0$.\n\nWe start by factoring the quadratic expression as $x^{2}-2x+m=x^{2}-2x+m-2+m=0$. Since the constant term is $m$, we can rewrite it as $0+m-2+m-2+m=0$. This allows us to write the equation as $(x-1)^{2}=n$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the value of $n$.\n\nNow that we have the equation $(x-1)^{2}=n$, we can square both sides to find the value of $n$. This gives us $n^{2}=n$. Since $n^{2}$ is a constant, we can write $n^{2}=0$. This implies that $n=0$.\n\nStep 3: Find the value of $m+n$.\n\nNow that we have the value of $n$, we can find the value of $m+n$ by adding $m$ to both sides of the equation. This gives us $m+n=0+m$.

The goal is to find the inverse function of $f(x)$, which is denoted as $f^{-1}(x)$.\n\nStep 2: Identify the inverse function\nTo find the inverse function, we need to interchange the roles of $x$ and $f(x)$, and then solve for $f(x)$. This is because the inverse function \"reverses\" the original function.\n\nStep 3: Interchange roles and solve for $f(x)$\nLet's swap the roles of $x$ and $f(x)$: $f(x)=1+\\log_{a}(x)$.

      "Let's break down the information given in the problem.\n\nWe know that the recipe calls for 12 cups of flour, 14 cups of sugar, and 7 cups of salt. We also know that Mary already put in some cups of flour. We don't know how many cups of flour she already put in, but we can use this information to determine the number of cups of flour she needs to add to the recipe.\n\nWe can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's say x is the number of cups of salt she needs to add. Since she already put in 3 more cups of salt, the total number of cups of salt she needs to add is x + 3.\n\nWe know that the total number of cups of flour she needs to add is 12 + x + x + 3 = 21 + 3x.\n\nWe also know that the total number of cups of flour she needs to add is 14 + x, since she already put in 3 more cups of salt.\n\nSetting these two equations equal to each other, we get:\n\n14 + x = 21 + 3x\n\nSubtracting 14 from both sides gives us:\n\n3x = 9\n\nDividing both sides by 3 gives us:\n\nx = 3\n\nSo, Mary already put in 3 cups of salt.\n\nNow that we know the number of cups of salt, we can add it to the number of cups of flour she needs to add. We know that the total number of cups of flour she needs to add is 12 + 3 + x = 15 + x.\n\nFinally, we can solve for x:\n\n15 + x = 21 + 3x\n\nSubtracting 15 from both sides gives us:\n\n2x = 10\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives us:\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, Mary already put in 5 cups of flour.\n\nThe final answer is that Mary already put in 5 cups of flour.",

She already put in 12 cups of flour, and she needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of salt. To find out how many cups of salt she needs to add, we'll subtract the number of cups of flour from the total amount of salt needed.\n\nNumber of cups of salt = Total amount of salt / Number of cups of salt\n= 7 cups / 1 cup (salt)\n= 7\n\nNow, let's subtract the number of cups of flour from the total amount of salt needed.\n\nNumber of cups of flour = Total amount of salt - Number of cups of flour\n= 7 - 12\n= -6\n\nSo, Mary already put in -6 cups of flour.\n\n2. Next, we need to add the number of cups of flour she already put in to the total amount of flour she needs to add.\n\nTotal amount of flour = Number of cups of flour + Number of cups of flour\n= -6 + 12\n= 6\n\nSo, Mary has already put in 6 cups of flour.",

      "To find the final answer, let's break down the given information:\n\nWe know that x is 20% more than y. This can be represented as x = y + 0.20y.\n\nWe also know that y is some percent less than z. We can represent this as y = (100 - x) / 100 * z.\n\nWe want to find the final answer in terms of z, so we'll express y in terms of z: y = (100 - x) / 100 * z.\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y into the equation x = y + 0.20y:\n\nx = (100 - x) / 100 * (100 - x) / 100\nx = (100 - x) / 100 * (100 - x)\n\nTo find the percentage decrease of y compared to z, we'll subtract the value of y from the value of x:\n\nPercentage decrease = (x - y) / x\n= ((100 - x) / 100 * (100 - x)) / (100 - x)\n= 100 / 100 - x / 100\n= 100 - (x / 100)\n= 99 / 100 - x / 100\n= (100 - 100 / 100) - (x / 100)\n= 99 / 100 - 100 / 100\n= -0.99\n\nNow we can convert this to a percentage:\n\nPercentage decrease = -0.99 * 100%\n= -99%\n\nSo the percentage decrease of y compared to z is -99%.",

We know that y is some percent less than z, so we can write an equation based on this: y = z - x.\n\nWe also know that x is 48% of z.

      "To find the final answer, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nWe know that the customer made a purchase of $ 110.\nThe store offered a payment plan consisting of a $ 10 down payment and 12 monthly payments of $ 10 each.\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the monthly payments:\n\nMonthly payments = $1000 / 12 = $83.33\n\nNow, let's calculate the interest paid on the purchase:\n\nInterest = Monthly payments * $1000 / 12\nInterest = $83.33 * $1000 / 12\nInterest = $833.33\n\nNext, we'll find the total interest paid:\n\nTotal interest = Interest + Purchase price\nTotal interest = $833.33 + $110\nTotal interest = $943.33\n\nNow, we'll calculate the final answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nThe customer paid $ 943.33 in interest by using this payment plan.",
      "To determine the percentage of the purchase price the customer paid in interest, we first need to calculate the total amount paid in interest for the purchase of $110.\n\nThe total amount paid in interest for the purchase is the sum of the monthly payments and the down payment. Since the down payment is $10 and there are 12 monthly payments, we can calculate the total amount paid in interest as follows:\n\nTotal amount paid in interest = Down payment + Monthly payments + Down payment\nTotal amount paid in interest = $10 + $10 + $10\nTotal amount paid in interest = $20\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage of the purchase price the customer paid in interest by dividing the total amount paid in interest by the purchase price and multiplying by 100:\n\nPercentage of interest paid = (Total amount paid in interest / Purchase price) * 100\nPercentage of interest paid = ($20 / $110) * 100\nPercentage of interest paid \u2248 18.18%\n\nSo, the customer paid approximately 18.18% of the purchase price in interest by using this payment plan.",
      "To find the total amount of interest paid, we need to calculate the total amount of each payment, and then subtract the total amount of each payment from the purchase price.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of each payment. The customer made a down payment of $10, and each monthly payment is $10. So, the total amount of each monthly payment is $10 * 12 = $120.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of interest paid. The total amount of interest paid is the total amount of each monthly payment (120) minus the total amount of each monthly payment (100).\n\nTotal amount of interest paid = Total amount of each monthly payment - Total amount of each monthly payment = 120 - 100 = $20.\n\nNow, let's convert the total amount of interest paid to a percentage. To do this, we need to divide the total amount of interest paid by the purchase price and multiply by 100.\n\nPercentage of interest paid = (Total amount of interest paid / Purchase price) * 100\nPercentage of interest paid = ($20 / $110) * 100 = 18.18%.\n\nSo, the customer paid 18.18% of the purchase price in interest by using this payment plan.",

      "To find the percent of the purchase price paid in interest, we need to calculate the total payment made by the customer and then find the portion of that payment that goes towards interest.\n\nThe total payment made by the customer is the sum of the down payment ($100) and the monthly payments ($100 each). So, the total payment is $100 + $100 = $200.\n\nThe monthly payments are $100 each. To find the total amount paid per month, we divide the total payment by the number of payments: $200 / 12 = $16.67.\n\nNow, we can calculate the portion of the total payment that goes towards interest. The interest is the total payment minus the down payment, so we subtract $100 from $200: $200 - $100 = $100.\n\nThe portion of the total payment that goes towards interest is $100 / $200 = 0.5 or 50%.\n\nTherefore, the customer paid 50% of the purchase price in interest by using this payment plan.",

      "To determine the number of cities to be selected from group B in a stratified sampling method, let's first understand the concept of stratified sampling.\n\nStratified sampling involves dividing a population into distinct subgroups, or strata, based on certain characteristics. The goal is to ensure that each subgroup has a representative sample size, which is typically less than the total sample size. This helps to reduce bias and increase the accuracy of the results.\n\nIn this case, we have three strata: A, B, and C. The population consists of $4$ cities in group A, $12$ cities in group B, and $8$ cities in group C.\n\nTo calculate the number of cities to be selected from group B, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.

Verify that the selected cities are representative of the population:\n- We can check if the selected cities are representative of group B by comparing the number of cities to be selected (12) to the actual number of cities in group B (12).\n\nNow, let's verify the calculated number of cities from group B:\n- $12 = 72 \\div 12$\n- $12 = 6 \\times 2$ (not equal)\n- $12 = 48 \\div 6$ (not equal)\n\nSince the calculated number of cities from group B is not equal to the actual number of cities in group B, the number of cities to be selected from group B is $12$.",

There is a square with a perimeter equal to the perimeter of this rectangle. We need to find the value of dividing the perimeter of this square into 4 equal parts.\n\nStep 2: Determine the perimeter of the square\nThe perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides. The length of each side is given as 64 cm, so the perimeter of the square is 64 cm + 64 cm + 64 cm + 64 cm = 320 cm.\n\nStep 3: Determine the length of each side of the square\nWe know that the square has a perimeter of 320 cm. Since the perimeter is divided into 4 equal parts, each side of the square is 320 cm / 4 = 80 cm.\n\nStep 4: Find the value of dividing the perimeter of the square into 4 equal parts\nWe need to divide the perimeter of the square into 4 equal parts, so we can divide 320 cm by 4.\n\n320 cm / 4 = 80 cm\n\nStep 5: Calculate the value of dividing the perimeter of the square into 4 equal parts\nSince the perimeter of the square is 80 cm, we can find the value of dividing the perimeter into 4 equal parts by dividing 80 cm by 4.\n\n80 cm / 4 = 20 cm\n\nThe value of dividing the perimeter of the square into 4 equal parts is 20 cm.",
      "To solve this problem, we first need to find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter is the distance around the rectangle's sides. Since the rectangle has a length and width, its perimeter can be found by adding the lengths of its sides.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 2(length + width). We are given that the perimeter is 36 cm, so we can write:\n\n2(length + width) = 36\n\nNow, we want to find the length and width such that the perimeter is 36 cm. This can be achieved if the length is 36/2 = 18 cm and the width is 18/2 = 9 cm.\n\nNow, we know that the rectangle is a square with a perimeter equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of the square is 4 * 9 = 36 cm.\n\nSo, the value of dividing the perimeter of this square into 4 equal parts is 36 / 4 = 9 cm.",

The perimeter P is given by the equation:\n\nP = L + W + L + W = 2L + 2W\n\nSince the length of the rectangle is 36 cm and the width is 64 cm, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:\n\nP = 36 + 64 + 36 + 64 = 200 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the perimeter of the square that is part of the rectangle. Let's denote the side length of the square as s.

The area A of a square is given by the formula:\n\nA = s^2\n\nSubstituting the value of s, we get:\n\nA = 50^2\n\nA = 2500 cm^2\n\nFinally, we want to divide the perimeter of the square into 4 equal parts. Since the perimeter of the square is 50 cm, we need to divide it by 4:\n\nPerimeter of the square = 50 / 4\n\nPerimeter of the square = 12.5 cm\n\nSo, the final answer is 12.5 cm.",

      "To solve this problem, let's start by understanding the relationship between the number of pages in each book.\n\nThe shortest book has 396 pages, and the book in the middle of Jasmine's shelf has 297 pages. This means that the difference between the number of pages in the shortest book and the longest book is 396 - 297 = 99 pages.\n\nSince the longest book is three times the number of pages in the shortest book, we can set up the equation 3 * 297 = 99 * x, where x is the number of pages in the longest book.\n\nNow, we can solve for x: 99x = 297 * 3. Dividing both sides by 99, we get x = 297 / 3, which simplifies to x = 99.\n\nSo, the number of pages in the longest book is 99.\n\nThe ratio of the number of pages in the shortest book to the longest book is 396:297. To simplify this ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 16, since 16 * 99 = 1680.\n\nThe ratio becomes 19:12.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the number of pages in the shortest book to the longest book is 19:12.",

      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Matt's math homework with a calculator takes him 2 minutes per problem, and he uses a calculator for 20 problems. This means that he spends a total of 2 minutes per problem * 20 problems = 40 minutes using a calculator.\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator. Since we know that using a calculator saves him 60 minutes, we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes to do a problem without a calculator.\n\nLet's say it takes Matt 1 minute to do a problem without a calculator. Then, we can set up the proportion: 1 minute / 40 minutes = x minutes / 20 problems.\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 1 * 20 = 40 * x. This simplifies to 20 = 40x. Dividing both sides by 40, we find that x = 2. This means that it takes Matt 2 minutes per problem without a calculator.\n\nSo, it takes Matt 2 minutes per problem to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "First, let's determine how much time Matt spends with a calculator and without a calculator.\n\nMatt spends 2 minutes per problem with a calculator, and there are 20 problems. So, the time he spends with a calculator is 2 * 20 = 40 minutes.\n\nMatt spends 60 minutes without a calculator. To find the time he spends without a calculator, we subtract the time he spends with a calculator from the total time: 60 - 40 = 20 minutes.\n\nNow, we know that Matt spends 2 minutes per problem with a calculator, and he spends 20 minutes without a calculator. To find the time he spends without a calculator, we add the time he spends with a calculator to the time he spends without a calculator: 20 + 2 = 22 minutes.\n\nSo, it takes Matt 22 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",

      "To determine how many minutes it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator, we need to consider the time it takes to do a problem with a calculator and a problem without a calculator.\n\nThe first thing to note is that it takes Matt 2 minutes per problem to do his math homework with a calculator, which means he does 20 problems in 20 minutes. This means that Matt's total time to do 20 problems without a calculator is 20 minutes.\n\nNow, let's consider the time it takes to do a problem without a calculator. Since Matt's homework assignment has 20 problems, we can assume that the time it takes for Matt to do a problem without a calculator is the same as the time it takes for Matt to do 20 problems with a calculator. In other words, Matt's time to do a problem without a calculator is 1 minute per problem, or 20 minutes.\n\nHowever, since we know that Matt's time to do 20 problems with a calculator is 20 minutes, we can conclude that the time it takes to do a problem without a calculator is 1 minute per problem.\n\nNow, we can find the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator by subtracting the time it takes to do 20 problems with a calculator from the time it takes to do 20 problems without a calculator. This gives us 20 minutes - 20 minutes = 0 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it takes Matt 0 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "To determine how many minutes it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator, let's first calculate how much time he saves with a calculator. Since he uses a calculator to do 2 problems per minute, he saves 2 minutes per problem. However, he still needs 20 problems to complete his assignment.\n\nWith a calculator, he saves 2 minutes per problem, but he still needs 20 problems to complete his assignment. Therefore, he saves 20 minutes per problem.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many minutes he saves without a calculator. He saves 20 minutes per problem, and he does 20 problems without a calculator. Therefore, he saves 20 minutes per problem * 20 problems = 400 minutes without a calculator.\n\nSince he saves 400 minutes without a calculator, and he does 20 problems per minute, he saves 400 minutes / 20 problems = 20 minutes per problem without a calculator.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of minutes it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator. He saves 20 minutes per problem, and he does 20 problems without a calculator. Therefore, it takes him 20 minutes / 20 problems = 1 minute without a calculator.\n\nSo, it takes Matt 1 minute to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Step 1: Determine the time Matt spends using a calculator.\nMatt spends 2 minutes per problem using a calculator.\nThere are 20 problems in the assignment.\nSo, Matt spends 2 minutes per problem x 20 problems = 40 minutes using a calculator.\n\nStep 2: Determine the time Matt spends without a calculator.\nMatt spends 60 minutes per problem without a calculator.\nThere are 20 problems in the assignment.\nSo, Matt spends 60 minutes per problem x 20 problems = 1200 minutes without a calculator.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the difference in time between using a calculator and without a calculator.\nMatt spends 40 minutes using a calculator and 1200 minutes without a calculator.\nThe difference is 1200 - 40 = 1160 minutes.\n\nStep 4: Determine how many minutes it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator.\nMatt spends 1200 minutes without a calculator.\nThere are 20 problems in the assignment.\nSo, Matt spends 1200 minutes per problem x 20 problems = 2400 minutes without a calculator.\n\nFinal Answer: Matt spends 40 minutes using a calculator and 1160 minutes without a calculator, which is 1160 - 40 = 1120 minutes.",
