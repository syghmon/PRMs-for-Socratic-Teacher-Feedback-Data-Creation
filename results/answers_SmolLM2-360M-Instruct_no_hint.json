      "To solve this problem, we can start by considering the properties of a trapezoid. A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with two parallel sides, called bases. The lateral sides of a trapezoid are the non-parallel sides.\n\nLet's denote the length of the base of the trapezoid as $c$, and the length of the base perpendicular to it as $d$. Since the trapezoid is divided into two smaller trapezoids by the given line parallel to the bases, we can conclude that the bases of the smaller trapezoids are $c$ and $d$.\n\nNow, let's consider the area of the original trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula:\n\n$$Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (h_1 + h_2) \\cdot (a_1 + a_2)$$\n\nwhere $h_1$ and $h_2$ are the lengths of the bases, $a_1$ and $a_2$ are the lengths of the lateral sides, and $c$ and $d$ are the lengths of the bases.\n\nWe know that the lateral sides are equal to $c$ and $d$, so we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n$$Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (c + d) \\cdot (c + d)$$\n\nWe can also express the area in terms of the lengths of the bases:\n\n$$Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot c \\cdot c + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot d \\cdot d$$\n\nNow, we need to find the lengths of the bases $c$ and $d$. Since the bases are equal, we can find one of them and then use it to find the other. Let's use the length of the base $c$ as a reference.\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is given by the formula:\n\n$$Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (c + d) \\cdot (c + d)$$\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for $d$:\n\n$$d = \\frac{Area}{(c + d)}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the length of $c$ and the length of $d$ into the formula for the area:\n\n$$Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (c + d) \\cdot (c + d)$$\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (c + d) \\cdot (c + d) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{c + d}{2} \\cdot \\frac{c + d}{2}$$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{c + d}{2} \\cdot \\frac{c + d}{2} = \\frac{c + d}{4}$$\n\n$$\\frac{c + d}{4} = \\frac{c}{2}$$\n\n$$\\frac{c + d}{4} = \\frac{d}{2}$$\n\n$$\\frac{c}{2} = \\frac{d}{2}$$\n\n$$c = 2d$$\n\nNow, we can find the length of $d$:\n\n$$d = \\frac{c}{2} = \\frac{2d}{2}$$\n\n$$d = d$$\n\nSo, the lengths of the bases of the original trapezoid are $c$ and $d$, which is the same as the lateral sides of the trapezoid.\n\nTherefore, the bases of the original trapezoid are $c$ and $d$.",

To find the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole, we divide the length of the hole (10 ft) by the time it takes Ryan (6 hours).\nTime for Ryan to dig the hole = 10 ft / 6 hours = 1.67 hours\n\nStep 3: Now, let's find out how long it takes Castel to dig the hole.\nCastel can dig the hole in 6 hours. To find the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole, we divide the length of the hole (10 ft) by the time it takes Castel (6 hours).\nTime for Castel to dig the hole = 10 ft / 6 hours = 1.67 hours\n\nStep 4: To find the time it takes for Ryan and Castel to dig the hole together, we subtract the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole from the time it takes for Ryan to dig the hole.\nTime for Ryan and Castel to dig the hole together = 1.67 hours - 1.67 hours = 0.07 hours\n\nStep 5: To find the time it takes for Ryan alone, we divide the length of the hole (10 ft) by the time it takes Ryan (0.07 hours).\nTime for Ryan alone = 10 ft / 0.07 hours = 142.85714285714286 hours\n\nSo, it takes Ryan alone approximately 142.86 hours to dig the hole.",

      "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe given quadratic function is y = -x^2 + 2x + m^2, and we want to find the value of m. We are given that the maximum value of the function is 3.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the function\nThe given function is in the form y = -x^2 + 2x + m^2. Since the maximum value of the function is 3, we can write an inequality to express this condition: -m^2 \u2264 2x + 3.\n\nStep 3: Solve the inequality\nTo find the value of m, we need to isolate m. We can do this by subtracting 2x from both sides of the inequality, which gives us -m^2 - 2x \u2264 3 - 2x. Then, we can factor the left-hand side as (-m - 2x)(1/2) \u2264 1/2, and simplify it to -m^2 - 2x \u2264 1/2.\n\nStep 4: Solve the inequality\nNow, we can rewrite the inequality as m^2 \u2264 1/4. We can further simplify this inequality by multiplying both sides by 4, which gives us m^2 \u2264 1/4.\n\nStep 5: Find the maximum value\nSince m^2 \u2264 1/4, we know that the maximum value of the function occurs when m^2 is as close to 1/4 as possible. The closest value to 1/4 is 1/4 itself, so the maximum value of the function is 1.\n\nStep 6: Express the answer in the form \u00b1\u221avalue\nTo express the maximum value of the function in the form \u00b1\u221avalue, we can take the square root of 1, which is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of the function is \u221a1 = 1.\n\nFinal answer: m^2 = 1, so m = \u00b11.",
      "To find the value of m, we first need to find the vertex of the parabola defined by the quadratic function y = -x^2 + 2x + m^2. We can use the formula for the vertex of a parabola in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, which is given by x = -b/(2a).\n\nIn this case, a = -1 and b = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get x = -2/(2(-1)) = -2/(-2) = 1.\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the corresponding y-coordinate using the formula y = -x^2 + 2x + m^2. Plugging in x = 1, we get y = -(1)^2 + 2(1) + m^2 = 1 + 2 + m^2.\n\nWe are given that the maximum value of the function is 3. So, we set up the inequality 3 > 1 + 2 + m^2, which simplifies to 4 > m^2.\n\nTo find the value of m, we take the square root of both sides of the inequality. Since we are looking for the positive square root, we take the positive square root. Therefore, m = \u221a4 > \u221am^2 = \u221a(4m^2) = 2m.\n\nSo, the value of m is \u221a4 > 2m = 2\u221a4 > 2. Therefore, the value of m is \u221a4 > 2.\n\nTo express this answer in the form \u00b1\u221avalue, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by 4 to get \u221a4 > 2. This is true for any value of m, so we can leave the answer in the form \u00b1\u221a4.\n\nTherefore, the value of m is \u221a4 > 2, which is equivalent to 2 > 4, or 2 > 4, or 4 > 2. However, we are given that the maximum value of the function is 3, so we can say that 4 > 2 is not true.\n\nThe correct answer is 4 > 2, or 4 > 2.",

      "Step 1: Determine the cost of each pencil and the cost of each eraser separately.\n\nLet's start by finding the cost of each pencil. Since each pencil costs $1 and the store sells 20 pencils, we can set up an equation to represent this:\n\nCost of each pencil = Number of pencils * $1\nCost of each pencil = 20 pencils * $1\nCost of each pencil = $20\n\nNow, let's find the cost of each eraser. Since each eraser costs $1 and the store sells 20 erasers, we can set up an equation to represent this:\n\nCost of each eraser = Number of erasers * $1\nCost of each eraser = 20 erasers * $1\nCost of each eraser = $20\n\nStep 2: Find the total cost of pencils and erasers.\n\nNow that we have the cost of each pencil and eraser, we can find the total cost of both items. We'll add the cost of each item to get the total cost:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of pencils + Cost of erasers\nTotal cost = $20 + $20\nTotal cost = $40\n\nStep 3: Determine the amount earned from selling pencils and erasers.\n\nSince each pencil costs $20 and each eraser costs $20, the store earned $40 from selling pencils and erasers.\n\nFinal answer: The store earned \\boxed{} from selling pencils and erasers.",
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We know that for every pencil you buy, you must buy 2 erasers which cost 1/2 the price of the pencils. So, if we have 20 pencils, the number of erasers needed would be 20 / 2 = 10 erasers.\n\n2. Now, we know the erasers cost $1 each, so the total cost of the erasers is 10 erasers * $1/2 = $5.\n\n3. We are given that the store sold 20 pencils for $1 each, so the total amount earned from selling pencils is 20 pencils * $1/2 = $10.\n\n4. We are also given that the store sold the erasers at a price of $1 each, so the total amount earned from selling erasers is 10 erasers * $1 = $10.\n\n5. To find the total amount earned from selling pencils and erasers, we need to add the amount earned from selling pencils and erasers. We already found that the store earned $10 from selling pencils and erasers, so we can add that to the amount earned from selling erasers: $10 + $10 = $20.\n\nFinal answer: The store earned $20 from selling pencils and erasers.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling pencils and erasers.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of pencils sold.\nWe know that the store sold 20 pencils, and each pencil costs $1. So, the total cost of pencils is 20 pencils * $1/pencil = $20.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of erasers sold.\nThe store sold 20 pencils, and each eraser costs $1/2 the price of a pencil. So, the total cost of erasers is 20 pencils * (1/2 eraser per pencil) = 10 erasers.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total revenue.\nThe total revenue is the sum of the revenue from selling pencils and erasers. Since each pencil sells for $1 and each eraser sells for $1/2 the price of a pencil, the total revenue is $20 (pencils) + $10 (erasers) = $30.\n\nSo, the store earned $30 from selling pencils and erasers. The hint provided that each pencil costs $1, so the store earned $30 from selling pencils and erasers, and $10 from selling erasers.",
      "To solve this problem, let's first consider the total number of pencils sold. We know that the store sold 20 pencils, and for each pencil, they sold 2 erasers. So, the total number of erasers sold is 20 * 2 = 40 erasers.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total price of the pencils and erasers. The store sold 20 pencils for $1 each, so the total price of the pencils is 20 * $1 = $20. The store also sold 40 erasers for $1 each, so the total price of the erasers is 40 * $1 = $40.\n\nThe total price of the pencils and erasers is the sum of the prices of the pencils and erasers: $20 + $40 = $60.\n\nTo find the total amount earned, we need to calculate the difference between the total price of the pencils and erasers and the total number of pencils sold. The difference is $60 - 20 = $40.\n\nTherefore, the store earned $40 from selling pencils and erasers.",
      "Let's break down the information given and work through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that for every pencil you buy, you must buy 2 erasers which cost 1/2 the price of the pencils. This means that the cost of the erasers is 1/2 the cost of a single pencil.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the erasers. Since each eraser costs $1, and there are 2 erasers per pencil, the total cost of the erasers is 2 * $1 = $2.\n\nWe're also given that the store sold 20 pencils. To find the total cost of pencils, we can use the information that the cost of the erasers is 1/2 the cost of a single pencil. Since the total cost of the erasers is $2, we can set up the equation:\n\n$2 = 1/2 * 20\n\nTo solve for $2, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n$4 = 2 * 20\n$4 = 40\n\nSo, the total cost of the pencils is $4.\n\nNow, let's find the total revenue the store earned from selling pencils and erasers. The store sold 20 pencils, and the total cost of pencils is $4. The cost of erasers is $2, so the total revenue is:\n\n$4 (cost of pencils) + $2 (cost of erasers) = $6\n\nTherefore, the store earned $6 from selling pencils and erasers."

We also know that the house numbers are consecutive integers, meaning they are spaced out in increments of 1.\n\nStep 3: Set up an equation\nLet's denote the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section as \"x\". Then, we can write the equation:\n\nx + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + ... + (x + 4) + (x + 5) = 117\n\nThis equation represents the sum of the house numbers on one side of the street from corner to corner.\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation\nTo simplify the equation, we can combine the terms within the parentheses:\n\nx + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + ... + (x + 4) + (x + 5) = 117\n\nx + (2x + 5) = 117\n\nStep 5: Solve for x\nNow, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation:\n\n2x + 5 = 117\n\nSubtracting 5 from both sides gives:\n\n2x = 112\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\nx = 56\n\nSo, the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section is 56.",

      "To solve this problem, let's start by using the given information. We are told that the sum of the house numbers on one side of a street from corner to corner is 117. This means that for every four houses on one side of the street, the sum of the house numbers is 117.\n\nWe are also given that the fifth house from the beginning of the section is the house with the number 7. We can use this information to calculate the number of houses on one side of the street from corner to corner.\n\nSince the sum of the house numbers on one side of the street is 117, we can divide 117 by 4 to find out how many houses are on one side of the street. This gives us 117 / 4 = 29.75 houses.\n\nSince we are looking for the number of houses on one side of the street from corner to corner, we need to subtract the number of houses from the street from corner to corner (which is 4 houses) from the total number of houses. This gives us 29.75 - 4 = 25.75 houses.\n\nNow that we know there are 25.75 houses on one side of the street, we can find the number of houses on the other side of the street by subtracting this value from the total number of houses on one side. This gives us 25.75 - 29.75 = -4.75 houses.\n\nSince we are looking for the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of the section, we need to find the house number that corresponds to the house number of -4.75 houses.\n\nThe house number that corresponds to -4.75 houses is the house number that is 4.75 units away from the beginning of the section. Since the house numbers on one side of the street are consecutive integers, the house number that is 4.75 units away from the beginning of the section is the house number 7.\n\nTherefore, the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of the section is 7.",
      "To find the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section, we can use the information given that the sum of the house numbers on one side of the street from corner to corner is 117.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of houses in the section from corner to corner. We know that the corner is the first house, and the entire street is 60 houses long. So, the total number of houses in the section from corner to corner is 60.\n\nNow, we can use the given information to find the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of the section. We know that the sum of the house numbers is 117, so we can set up an equation:\n\n60 + (5 * 5) = 117\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n60 + 25 = 117\n\nNow, subtract 60 from both sides:\n\n25 = 117 - 60\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 25:\n\n(117 - 60) / 25 = 5\n\nSo, the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section is 5.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply some basic arithmetic.\n\nStep 1: Find the sum of the house numbers from the corner to the beginning of the street.\n\nWe are given that the sum of the house numbers on one side of the street from corner to corner is 117. We can write this as:\n117 + (117 + 117 + ... + 117) = 117 + 117 + ... + 117\n\nSince we are adding 117 to itself, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n117 + 117 + 117 + ... + 117 = 117 + 117 + ... + 117 + 117\n\nNow, let's sum the first 117 terms:\n117 + 117 + 117 + ... + 117 = 117 + 117 + 117 + ... + 117 + 117\n\nThis is a geometric series with a common ratio of 117. The sum of an infinite geometric series can be calculated using the formula:\nSum = a / (1 - r)\n\nwhere a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, a = 117 and r = 117. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nSum = 117 / (1 - 117)\nSum = 117 / (-16)\nSum = -75\n\nSo, the sum of the house numbers on one side of the street from corner to corner is -75.\n\nNow, we need to find the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section. We can do this by adding 5 to -75:\n5 = -75 + 5\n\nAdding 5 to the result, we get:\n5 = -70\n\nSo, the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of this section is 5."

      "Step 1: Simplify the given equation.\n\nThe given equation is $9a^2 + b^2 - 6a - 2b = 0$. We can start by factoring the quadratic expression. We can rewrite the equation as $9a^2 + b^2 - 6a - 2b = 0$. Factoring the quadratic expression gives us $9a^2 + 9b^2 - 6a - 2b = 9(a^2 - b^2) - 6(a - b)$.\n\nStep 2: Find the maximum value of $a^2 - b^2$.\n\nWe can now find the maximum value of $a^2 - b^2$ by taking the derivative of $a^2 - b^2$ with respect to $a$ and setting it equal to zero. The derivative of $a^2 - b^2$ is $2a - 2b$. Setting the derivative equal to zero gives us $2a - 2b = 0$. Solving for $a$ and $b$, we get $a = \\frac{b}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{a}{2}$.\n\nStep 3: Apply the maximum value of $a^2 - b^2$ to $9a^2 + b^2 - 6a - 2b$.\n\nNow we can plug in the values of $a = \\frac{b}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{a}{2}$ into the equation $9a^2 + b^2 - 6a - 2b = 0$. This gives us $9(\\frac{b}{2})^2 + \\frac{a}{2}^2 - 6(\\frac{b}{2}) + \\frac{a}{2} - 2(\\frac{a}{2}) = 0$.

We can now distribute the terms in the numerator. This gives us $9(\\frac{b^2}{4}) - 6(\\frac{b}{2}) + \\frac{a^2}{4} = 0$.\n\nStep 5: Solve for $a^2 - b^2$ and $a$ and $b$.\n\nWe can now solve for $a^2 - b^2$ and $a$ and $b$ by adding and subtracting the same terms on the left-hand side of the equation. This gives us $9(\\frac{b^2}{4}) - 6(\\frac{b}{2}) + 9(\\frac{a^2}{4}) - 6(\\frac{a}{2}) = 0$. Simplifying this equation gives us $9(\\frac{b^2 - 2b}{4}) + 9(\\frac{a^2 - 2a}{4}) = 0$.\n\nStep 6: Solve for $a$ and $b$.\n\nNow we can solve for $a$ and $b$ by distributing the terms in the numerator. This gives us $9(\\frac{b^2 - 2b}{4}) + 9(\\frac{a^2 - 2a}{4}) = 0$. We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by $9$ to get $(\\frac{b^2 - 2b}{4}) + (\\frac{a^2 - 2a}{4}) = 0$.\n\nStep 7: Solve for $a$ and $b$.\n\nNow we can solve for $a$ and $b$ by subtracting $2b$ and $2a$ from both sides of the equation. This gives us $(\\frac{b^2 - 2b}{4}) + (\\frac{a^2 - 2a}{4}) = 0$.\n\nStep 8: Solve for $a$ and $b$.\n\nNow we can solve for $a$ and $b$ by subtracting $2b$ and $2a$ from both sides of the equation.

The numbers that satisfy these conditions are $-3$ and $2$, since $3\\cdot2=-6$ and $-3\\cdot2=2$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the quadratic expression as $(3a+2b)(3a-2b)=9a^{2}+2ab+3a-2b$, and we can factor this expression as $(3a+2b)(3a-2b)=9(a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab)$.\n\nNow, we can take the derivative of both sides of the equation to find the maximum value of $3a+b$. Differentiating $(3a+2b)(3a-2b)=9(a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab)$, we get $(3a-2b)(6a+2b)=0$.\n\nSetting $(3a-2b)=0$, we get $3a=2b$, so $a=b$.

The tank can be emptied at a rate of 4 litres per minute by Inlet Pipe B.\n\nWhen the tank is full, the rate at which the tank is emptied is equal to the rate at which the tank is filled, since the leak is not happening while the tank is full.\n\nThe total rate at which the tank is filled and emptied is the sum of the rates at which it is filled and emptied by Inlet Pipe A and Inlet Pipe B. We know that the tank is full in 12 hours.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nInlet Pipe A fills the tank at a rate of 6 litres per minute. Inlet Pipe B fills the tank at a rate of 4 litres per minute.\n\nThe total rate at which the tank is filled is:\n\n(6 litres/minute) + (4 litres/minute) = 10 litres/minute\n\nSince the tank is full in 12 hours, we can set up the following equation:\n\n10 litres/minute = (12 hours * 10 litres/hour) / (12 hours * 12 hours)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n10 litres/minute = 100 litres/12 hours\n\nNow, we can solve for the rate at which the tank is filled per hour:\n\n100 litres/12 hours = 10 litres per hour\n\nSo, the rate at which the tank is filled per hour is 10 litres per hour.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the tank is filled at a rate of 10 litres per hour by Inlet Pipe A to find the rate at which the tank is emptied per hour:\n\nRate at which the tank is emptied per hour = 10 litres per hour - 10 litres per hour = -10 litres per hour\n\nThe tank is empty in 12 hours, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n-10 litres per hour = (12 hours * -10 litres per hour) / (12 hours * 12 hours)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n-10 litres per hour = -100 litres per hour\n\nNow, we can solve for the rate at which the tank is emptied per hour:\n\n-100 litres per hour = 10 litres per hour\n\nSo, the rate at which the tank is emptied per hour is 10 litres per hour.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the tank is emptied at a rate of 10 litres per hour by Inlet Pipe B to find the rate at which the tank is filled per hour:\n\nRate at which the tank is filled per hour = 10 litres per hour + 10 litres per hour = 20 litres per hour\n\nThe tank holds 6 litres of water at the start of the problem. We can use the fact that the tank is full in 12 hours to find the rate at which the tank is full per hour:\n\nRate at which the tank is full per hour = 6 litres per hour\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the tank is filled at a rate of 10 litres per hour by Inlet Pipe A to find the rate at which the tank is empty per hour:\n\nRate at which the tank is empty per hour = 10 litres per hour - 10 litres per hour = -10 litres per hour\n\nThe tank holds 6 litres of water at the start of the problem.

      "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the rate at which the tank is filled and the rate at which the tank is emptied due to the leak.\n\nThe tank is filled by two inlet pipes. Let's denote the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe A as 'A' and the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe B as 'B'. The tank is emptied by Pipe C, which fills the tank at a rate of 4 litres per minute.\n\nWe know that the tank is full when the rate at which it is filled by Pipe A is equal to the rate at which it is emptied by Pipe C. This means that the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe A is equal to the rate at which the tank is emptied by Pipe C.\n\nLet's denote the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe A as 'A' and the rate at which the tank is emptied by Pipe C as 'B'. We are given that the tank is full when A + B = 0, which means that A = -B.\n\nNow, we need to find the rate at which the tank is emptied by Pipe C. Since the tank is empty after 12 hours, the rate at which the tank is emptied by Pipe C is the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe A minus the rate at which the tank is emptied by Pipe C. This means that the rate at which the tank is emptied by Pipe C is -B - (A + B) = -B - A = -2A.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation based on the given information:\n\nA + B = 0\nA = -B\n\nSince A + B = 0, we can substitute this into the equation A = -B to get:\n\n-B = -B\n\nThis simplifies to 0 = 0, which is true. This means that the rate at which the tank is emptied by Pipe C is equal to the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe A, which means that the tank is full when the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe A is equal to the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe C.\n\nThe rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe A is 6 litres per minute. Since the tank is full when A + B = 0, we can set up the equation:\n\n6 + B = 0\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get:\n\nB = -6\n\nNow that we have the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe A, we can find the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe B. The rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe B is 4 litres per minute, since it is filling the tank at a rate of 6 + 4 = 10 litres per minute.\n\nSince the tank is full when A + B = 0, we can set up the equation:\n\n6 + B = 0\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get:\n\nB = -6\n\nNow that we have the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe A, we can find the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe C. The rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe C is -2A, since it is emptying the tank at a rate of 4 - 2A litres per minute.\n\nSince the tank is full when A + B = 0, we can set up the equation:\n\n6 + B = 0\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get:\n\nB = -6\n\nNow that we have the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe A, we can find the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe C. The rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe C is -2A, since it is emptying the tank at a rate of 4 - 2A litres per minute.\n\nSince the tank is full when A + B = 0, we can set up the equation:\n\n6 + B = 0\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get:\n\nB = -6\n\nNow that we have the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe A, we can find the rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe B. The rate at which the tank is filled by Pipe B is 4 + 2A, since it is filling the tank at a rate of 6 + 4 = 10 litres per minute.\n\nSince the tank is full when A + B = 0, we can set up the equation:\n\n6 + B = 0\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get:\n\nB = -6\n\nNow that we have the rate at which the tank is filled by"

There are 4 students who participate on both Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThe probability of choosing a student participating on both Saturday and Sunday is the number of students participating on both days divided by the total number of days where there are students participating.\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\n(4 students / 24 days) / (12 days / 24 days)\n\nFirst, simplify the fraction:\n\n(4 / 24) / (12 / 24)\n\nNow, simplify the fraction further:\n\n(1/3) / (1/2)\n\nTo simplify further, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.\n\n(1/3) / (1/2) = (3/3) / (2/2) = 3/2\n\nSo, the probability of choosing a student participating on both Saturday and Sunday is 3/2 or 1.5.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{}",
      "Hint: To find the probability of selecting two events that occur together, we need to first find the probability of selecting only one event and then subtract that from 1.\n\nStep 1: Find the probability of selecting only one event\nThere are 3 students choosing one day out of Saturday and Sunday. The probability of selecting only one day is the number of favorable outcomes (students participating on one day) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (students participating on either day).\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes = 3\nTotal number of possible outcomes = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nProbability of selecting only one event = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n= 3 / 6\n= 1/2\n\nStep 2: Find the probability of selecting two events that occur together\nThere are two events: either students will participate on Saturday and Sunday, or students will participate on Sunday only.\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes for both events happening together = 2\nTotal number of possible outcomes for both events happening together = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nProbability of selecting two events that occur together = Number of favorable outcomes for both events happening together / Total number of possible outcomes for both events happening together\n= 2 / 5\n= 2/5\n\nStep 3: Subtract the probability of selecting only one event from the probability of selecting two events that occur together\n\nProbability of selecting only one event = 1/2\nProbability of selecting two events that occur together = 2/5\n\nDifference = Probability of selecting only one event - Probability of selecting two events that occur together\n= 1/2 - 2/5\n= 1/10\n\nSo, the probability that there will be students participating on both Saturday and Sunday is 1/10, or 10/100.

      "To find the probability that there will be students participating on both Saturday and Sunday, we first need to determine the total number of students who can participate on either Saturday or Sunday.\n\nOn Saturday, there are 7 students. On Sunday, there are 5 students. So, the total number of students who can participate on either Saturday or Sunday is 7 (Saturday) + 5 (Sunday) = 12 students.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of students who can participate on both Saturday and Sunday. To do this, we need to choose 2 students out of the total number of students who can participate on either Saturday or Sunday. This can be calculated using the combination formula, which is given by nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of students and r is the number of students we are choosing.\n\nIn this case, n = 12 (total number of students who can participate on either Saturday or Sunday) and r = 2 (students we are choosing to participate on both Saturday and Sunday).\n\nSo, the number of students who can participate on both Saturday and Sunday is 12C2 = 12! / (2!(12-2)!) = 66.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that there will be students participating on both Saturday and Sunday by dividing the number of students who can participate on both by the total number of students who can participate on either Saturday or Sunday.\n\nProbability = (Number of students who can participate on both) / (Total number of students who can participate on either Saturday or Sunday)\nProbability = 66 / 12\nProbability = 5.55\n\nSo, the probability that there will be students participating on both Saturday and Sunday is approximately 5.55 or 555%.",

This is the sum of the number of students participating on each day:\n\nNumber of students participating on Saturday = 20\nNumber of students participating on Sunday = 20\nTotal number of students = 20 + 20 = 40\n\nNow, let's find the number of students who can participate on both days. This is the sum of the number of students participating on each day and the number of students who can participate on both days:\n\nNumber of students participating on Saturday and Sunday = 20 (students participating on Saturday) + 20 (students participating on Sunday) = 40\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability that there will be students participating on both Saturday and Sunday by dividing the number of students who can participate on both days by the total number of students:\n\nProbability = Number of students participating on both Saturday and Sunday / Total number of students = 40 / 40 = 1\n\nSo, the probability that there will be students participating on both Saturday and Sunday is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: 1."

If we place a ball on one of the sides, the box will be divided into two smaller rectangles. The largest possible ball that can fit inside the smaller rectangle is the one that is 1/2 of the side length of the smaller rectangle.\n\nSince the box is a square with sides of length $10$, the largest ball that can fit inside the smaller rectangle is 1/2 of the side length of the smaller rectangle, which is 5 units.\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum number of balls that can fit inside the box. We can do this by placing the largest ball that can fit inside the smaller rectangle, which is 1/2 of the side length of the smaller rectangle, and then placing the next largest ball that fits inside the remaining space.\n\nThe next largest ball that fits inside the remaining space is 1/4 of the side length of the smaller rectangle.

The key point to remember is that the car is moving in the same direction as it started (east).\n\nWhen the car travels 5 kilometers to the west, it effectively moves in the opposite direction of its initial movement. This means that the initial 5 kilometers to the east is now the starting point for the final movement.\n\nNow, let's calculate the new distance traveled:\n\nNew distance = Initial distance + Final movement\nNew distance = 5 kilometers + 5 kilometers (west movement)\nNew distance = 10 kilometers\n\nSo, traveling 5 kilometers to the west would be recorded as 10 kilometers.\n\nThe final answer is 10 kilometers."

      "To find the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points, we need to find the z-scores for these values and then look up the corresponding probabilities in a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the z-scores:\n\n- The z-score for a score of 80 is: (80 - 80) / 100 = 0.\n- The z-score for a score of 90 is: (90 - 80) / 100 = 0.1.\n\nNow, we can look up the probabilities in a standard normal distribution table. The z-table lists the probabilities for different z-scores. We need to find the probability that a student scored between 80 and 90 points.\n\nUsing a z-table, we find that the probability of a student scoring between 0 and 0.1 is approximately 0.05, or 5%.\n\nSo, the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points is approximately 5%.",

After that, she put the remaining files into folders with 12 files in each.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many folders Megan has after deleting the files. We know that Megan had 256 files initially. After deleting 67 files, she has 256 - 67 = 189 files left.\n\nSince each folder has 12 files in it, we can divide the number of files left (189) by the number of files in each folder (12) to find out how many folders she has. \n\n189 / 12 = 15\n\nThis means Megan has 15 folders.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many folders Megan has after putting the remaining files into folders with 12 files in each.

Since Megan has 15 folders, we can divide the number of folders (15) by the number of files in each folder (12) to find out how many files each folder can hold.\n\n15 / 12 = 1.25\n\nThis means each folder can hold 1.25 times the number of files in each folder. Since Megan has 15 folders, each folder can hold 1.25 * 15 = 19.75 files.\n\nTo find out how many files each folder can hold, we can divide the total number of files (256) by the number of files in each folder (19.75).\n\n256 / 19.75 = 14.84\n\nThis means each folder can hold approximately 14.84 files.\n\nTherefore, Megan has 15 folders, and each folder can hold approximately 14.84 files.",

      "To solve this problem, let's first calculate how much money Logan has left each year after spending on rent, groceries, and gas.\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the amount Logan spends on rent each year. Logan's annual salary is $65,000, and he spends $20,000 on rent. So, his annual rent is $65,000 - $20,000 = $45,000.\n\nNext, we'll calculate the amount Logan spends on groceries each year. Logan's annual salary is $65,000, and he spends $5000 on groceries. So, his annual grocery expenditure is $65,000 - $5000 = $60,000.\n\nFinally, we'll calculate the amount Logan spends on gas each year. Logan's annual salary is $65,000, and he spends $8000 on gas. So, his annual gas expenditure is $65,000 - $8000 = $57,000.\n\nNow, we'll add up the amount Logan spends on rent, groceries, and gas each year to find his total expenditure. His annual expenditure is $45,000 (rent) + $60,000 (groceries) + $57,000 (gas) = $172,000.\n\nSince Logan needs to make $10,000 more each year, we can subtract this amount from his total expenditure to find how much money he has left each year. His total expenditure is $172,000 - $10,000 = $162,000.\n\nSo, Logan wants to have $162,000 left each year.",

      "To solve this problem, we need to find the width of the floor. We'll start by using the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length \u00d7 Width. We know the length of the floor is 10 m and the width is not given.

The area of one side is 4 square meters, so the area of the entire carpet is 16 square meters divided by 4 square meters per side, which equals 4 square meters.\n\nNow that we have the area of the carpet, we can find the area of the floor by subtracting the uncovered area from the total area of the carpet. The area of the floor is 16 square meters minus 64 square meters, which equals 4 square meters.\n\nThe width of the floor is the side length of the carpet divided by 2, since we want to find the width of one side of the carpet.

Since 6 of his marbles are dark blue, we can find the number of dark blue marbles by subtracting the number of green marbles from the total number of marbles.\n\nDark blue marbles = Total marbles - Green marbles\n   Dark blue marbles = 38 - 14\n   Dark blue marbles = 24\n\n2. Now, let's find the number of green marbles Fred has. We know that half of Fred's marbles are green, so we can find the number of green marbles by multiplying the total number of marbles by 2.\n\nGreen marbles = Total marbles * 2\n   Green marbles = 38 * 2\n   Green marbles = 76\n\n3. Now, let's find the total number of marbles Fred has. We know that Fred has 38 red marbles, half as many green ones, and the rest are dark blue.\n\nTotal marbles = Red marbles + Green marbles + Dark blue marbles\n   Total marbles = 38 + 24 + 76\n   Total marbles = 100\n\n4. Finally, we can find the total number of marbles Fred has by adding the number of dark blue marbles to the total number of marbles.\n\nTotal marbles = Dark blue marbles + Total marbles\n   Total marbles = 24 + 100\n   Total marbles = 124\n\nTherefore, Fred has a total of 124 marbles."

      "To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of time Matt spends doing a problem without a calculator. We know that he uses a calculator for 60 minutes. This means that he spends 60 minutes + 2 minutes per problem (to use a calculator) + 2 minutes per problem (without a calculator), but since he spends 60 minutes using a calculator and 2 minutes per problem without a calculator, we can subtract 2 minutes from the total minutes spent using a calculator to find the time spent without a calculator.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total minutes spent using a calculator. We know that Matt uses a calculator for 60 minutes, so we can subtract this from the total minutes spent using a calculator to find the time spent without a calculator: 60 minutes - 60 minutes = 0 minutes.\n\nSince Matt spends 2 minutes per problem without a calculator, and he uses a calculator for 60 minutes, we can subtract the 2 minutes spent without a calculator from the total minutes spent without a calculator: 0 minutes - 2 minutes = 2 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it takes Matt 2 minutes per problem without a calculator.",
      "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to determine how many minutes Matt spends doing his math homework with and without a calculator.\n2. Then, we can find out how many minutes it takes him to do a problem without a calculator.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the time spent doing the math homework with a calculator\nMatt spends 2 minutes per problem using a calculator. He has 20 problems to do. So, the time spent doing the math homework with a calculator is 20 problems * 2 minutes/problem = 40 minutes.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the time spent doing the math homework without a calculator\nMatt spends 60 minutes per hour. He has 60 minutes to do the math homework without a calculator. So, the time spent doing the math homework without a calculator is 60 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1 hour.\n\nStep 3: Find out how many minutes it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator\nMatt needs to do 40 minutes to do the math homework with a calculator, and 1 hour to do the math homework without a calculator. So, it takes Matt 40 minutes + 1 hour = 50 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.\n\nFinal answer: It takes Matt 50 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Matt uses a calculator to do his math homework. This means he uses 2 minutes per problem without a calculator.\n2. The total time it takes for Matt to do his math homework is the sum of the time he spends using a calculator and the time he spends without a calculator.\n\nLet's denote the number of problems in the 20-problem assignment as x.\n\nUsing a calculator:\nTime spent using a calculator = 2x minutes\n\nWithout a calculator:\nTime spent without a calculator = x minutes\n\nThe total time it takes for Matt to do his math homework is the sum of the time spent using a calculator and the time spent without a calculator:\n2x + x = 20\n\nCombine the terms:\n3x = 20\n\nDivide by 3:\nx = 20 / 3\nx = 6.67\n\nSo, Matt spends 6.67 minutes without a calculator to do his math homework.\n\nFinal Answer: Matt spends 6.67 minutes without a calculator to do his math homework.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the time Matt spends using a calculator and the time he spends without a calculator.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the problem: Matt's assignment has 20 problems. He uses a calculator to solve 2 minutes per problem, and he uses a calculator for 15 minutes without a calculator. Then, he uses a calculator for 15 minutes without a calculator. This is equivalent to using a calculator for 15 minutes per problem.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator:\n\nTime without a calculator = Time with a calculator + Time without a calculator\n= 2 minutes / problem + 15 minutes / problem\n= 17 minutes per problem\n\nSince Matt has 20 problems, we can calculate the total time it takes him to do a problem without a calculator:\n\nTime without a calculator * Number of problems = Total time\n17 minutes / problem * 20 problems = 340 minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes Matt 340 minutes to do a problem without a calculator."
