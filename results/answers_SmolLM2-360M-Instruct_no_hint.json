      "To find the bases of the trapezoid, we need to use the information given about the bases of the given right trapezoid. Since the bases are equal to $c$ and $d$, we can use this information to set up the following equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= c \\\\\nx + z &= d\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere $x$ is the length of the side parallel to the base $ab$ and $z$ is the length of the side parallel to the base $cd$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these equations into the equation for the area of the trapezoid:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA(ab) &= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot h \\cdot (x + y) \\\\\nA(cd) &= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot h \\cdot (x + z) \\\\\nA(ab) &= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot h \\cdot (c + d) \\\\\nA(cd) &= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot h \\cdot (d + c) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $c < d$, we have $c < h$. Therefore, $h = c - c = 0$.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation for the area of the trapezoid, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA(ab) &= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 \\cdot (x + y) \\\\\nA(ab) &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince the area of the trapezoid is zero, the bases must be equal to $c$.

      "Step 1: Determine the sides of the trapezoid\nSince the line parallel to the bases of the given right trapezoid splits it into two smaller trapezoids, each of which can have a circle inscribed in it, we need to determine the lengths of the lateral sides of the trapezoid.\n\nStep 2: Determine the lengths of the lateral sides\nThe lateral sides of a trapezoid can be found by subtracting the lengths of the two bases from the length of the slant side.

      "To find the bases of the given right trapezoid, we can use the fact that a line parallel to one of its bases splits it into two smaller trapezoids. Let's denote the length of the bases as $c$ and the length of the lateral sides as $d$. Since the line parallel to one of the bases is parallel to both bases, it will intersect the bases at the same point, which is also the midpoint of the base.\n\nNow, consider the smaller trapezoid formed by the line parallel to the bases and the lateral sides. This trapezoid has two bases of length $c$ and $d$ (the bases of the original trapezoid) and a height of $c+d$. Since the line parallel to the bases is also parallel to the bases of the trapezoid, the height of the smaller trapezoid is also $c+d$.\n\nNow, let's find the area of the original trapezoid.

      "To find the bases of the original trapezoid, we can use the following reasoning:\n\nSince the line parallel to the bases of the given right trapezoid splits it into two smaller trapezoids, each of which can have a circle inscribed in it, we can find the bases of each smaller trapezoid by using the properties of the trapezoid.\n\nLet's start with the smaller trapezoid with bases $c$ and $d$. This trapezoid can be divided into two triangles by drawing a line from the midpoint of the base $c$ to the point where the base $d$ intersects the line parallel to $c$ and $d$. The two triangles formed by this line and the base $d$ are similar, since the line parallel to $c$ and $d$ is also parallel to the bases $c$ and $d$.\n\nUsing the properties of similar triangles, we can find the ratio of the corresponding sides of the two triangles. Since the ratio of the sides of a triangle is equal to the ratio of their corresponding sides, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$\\frac{c}{d}=\\frac{a}{b}$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the segments of the base $c$ and $d$, respectively.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values for $c$ and $d$ into the equation:\n\n$c/d=\\frac{a}{b}$\n\n$c=d\\cdot a$\n\n$c=d\\cdot b$\n\nSubstituting the given values for $a$ and $b$, we get:\n\n$c=d\\cdot b$\n\n$c=d\\cdot b=c$\n\nThis means that the bases of the original trapezoid are equal to $c$ and $d$, where $c<d$.\n\nTherefore, the bases of the original trapezoid are $c$ and $d$, which are equal to the given values."

      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We know that Ryan can dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole in a certain amount of time. This means that his digging speed is 10 ft / 10 ft = 1 hour.\n\n2. We also know that Castel can dig the same hole in six hours. This means that his digging speed is 10 ft / 6 h = 1.67 ft / h.\n\n3. To find out how much time it takes for Castel to dig the hole alone, we can divide the total distance he needs to dig (10 ft) by his digging speed (1.67 ft / h). This gives us 10 ft / 1.67 ft / h = 6 hours.\n\n4. Now, let's consider what would happen if they worked together. Since they can dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole in 6 hours, we can divide the total distance they need to dig (10 ft) by the combined digging speed (6 h). This gives us 10 ft / (6 h * 1.67 ft / h) = 10 ft / (6 h * 1.67 ft / h) = 10 ft / 9.34 ft = 1.11 hours.\n\n5. Since the problem asks for the number of hours it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone, we can subtract the combined time it takes for them to dig the hole (6 hours) from the time it takes for Castel to dig the hole alone (1.11 hours). This gives us 1.11 hours - 6 hours = 5.11 hours.\n\nSo, it would take Ryan 5.11 hours to dig the hole alone.",

Since they work alone, we can subtract the time they spend together from the total time it takes for both of them to dig the hole.\n\nRyan and Castel can dig the hole together in 6 hours, so together they take 6 hours. Therefore, it takes them 6 hours to dig the hole.\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it takes for Ryan to dig the hole alone.

      "To find the coefficient of $x^3y^3$ in the expansion of $(x+2y)(2x-y)^5$, we can use the Binomial Theorem, which states that for any non-negative integer $n$, the expansion of $(x+a)^n$ is given by the sum of terms of the form $x^n + nx^(n-1)a + n(n-1)x^(n-2)a^2 + ... + a^n$.\n\nIn our case, we have $(x+2y)(2x-y)^5$. We can expand the first term $(x+2y)$ as $x^5 + 2x^4y + 2x^3y^2 + 2x^2y^3 + x^1y^4$, which is a binomial expansion.\n\nNow, we can expand the second term $(2x-y)^5$ as $100x^4y^5 - 100xy^3(2y)^5 + 100xy^2(2y)^4 - xy^3(2y)^3 - xy(2y)^2 - y^3$.\n\nTo find the coefficient of $x^3y^3$, we need to find the sum of the coefficients of the terms $x^3y^3$, $x^3y^3$, and $x^3y^3$. We can do this by adding the coefficients of the terms that contain $x^3y^3$:\n\n$100x^4y^5 - 100xy^3(2y)^5 + 100xy^2(2y)^4 - xy^3(2y)^3 - xy(2y)^2 - y^3$.\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$-100x^4y^5 + 100x^3y^3 - 100x^2y^3 - 100xy^2y^2 - 100xy^3y^3$.\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n$-100x^4y^5 - 100x^3y^3 + 100x^2y^3 - 100xy^2y^2 - 100xy^3y^3$.\n\nNow, we can add these terms to find the coefficient of $x^3y^3$:\n\n$-100(x^4 + 3x^3y^2 + 2x^2y^3 + xy^4) + 100(x^2y^3 - xy^2y^3 - 2xy^3y^3) - 100(xy^3 - xy^2y^3 - xy^3y^3)$.\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$-100x^4y^5 - 100x^3y^3 + 100x^2y^3 - 100xy^2y^2 - 100xy^3y^3 - 100x^3y^2 + 100x^2y^2 - 100xy^2y^2 - 100xy^3y^2$.\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n$-100x^4y^5 - 100x^3y^3 + 100x^2y^3 - 100xy^2y^2 - 100xy^3y^3 - 100x^3y^2 + 100x^2y^2 - 100xy^2y^2 - 100xy^3y^2 + 100x^4y^5$.\n\nDividing the entire expression by $x^2y^2$, we get:\n\n$-100x^4y^5 + 100x^3y^3 + 100x^2y^3 - 100xy^2y^2 - 100xy^3y^3 - 100x^3y^2 + 100x^2y^2 - 100xy^2y^2 - 100xy^3y^2 + 100x^4y^5$.\n\nThis is the desired coefficient.",

The leak occurs when the tank is empty, and the rate of filling is 1.5 litres per minute. This means the leak is filling the tank at a rate of 1.5 - 1.5 = 0.5 litres per minute.\n\n4. Since the tank is empty, the rate of filling is 0.5 litres per minute.\n\n5. We are given that both inlet pipes are opened simultaneously when the tank is full, and due to the leak, the tank is empty in 12 hours. This means the total time it takes to empty the tank is 12 hours.\n\n6. We can set up an equation using the given information:\n\nRate of filling (A) * Time to fill (A) = Rate of filling (B) * Time to fill (B)\n1.5 * 4 = 0.5 * 12\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n6 = 6\n\nThis equation is true.\n\n7. Since the rate of filling (A) is 1.5 litres per minute, the rate of filling (B) is 1.5 / 6 = 0.25 litres per minute.\n\n8. We are given that the leak occurs when the tank is empty, and the rate of filling is 1.5 - 0.25 = 1.25 litres per minute.\n\n9. Using the equation from step 6, we can find the time it takes to empty the tank:\n\nRate of filling (B) * Time to empty (B) = Rate of filling (A) * Time to fill (A)\n1.25 * 12 = 1.5 * 4\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n15 = 6\n\nThis equation is true.\n\n10. Now, we can find the total time it takes to empty the tank:\n\nTime to empty (B) = Time to fill (B) - Time to fill (A)\n12 - 4 = 8\n\nTherefore, the cistern holds 8 litres.",

To do this, we can set the two lines equal to each other and solve for $m$:\n\n$x+y-m=0$\n$x+(3-2m)y=0$\n\n$x+y-m = 3 - 2m$\n$x+(3-2m)y = 0$\n\n$x = 3 - 2m$ and $y = 3 - 2m$\n\nNow, we can set these two equations equal to each other:\n\n$3 - 2m = 3 - 2m$\n\nSubtracting $3 - 2m$ from both sides:\n\n$0 = m$\n\nSo, we have found that the line $x+y-m=0$ is perpendicular to the line $x+(3-2m)y=0$.\n\nStep 5: Find the value of the real number $m$\nNow that we know the line $x+y-m=0$ is perpendicular to the line $x+(3-2m)y=0$, we can find the value of the real number $m$ by plugging in the slope of the perpendicular line:\n\n$m = \\frac{m'}{3 - 2m}$\n\nSubstituting the values of $m'$ and $m$:\n\n$m = \\frac{-0.67}{3 - 2(1.67)}$\n\n$m = -0.67 / 2.67$\n\n$m = -0.23$\n\nSo, the value of the real number $m$ is -0.23."

It then runs above a fallen tree trunk of a certain length in 5 seconds. The length of the tiger is 5 meters.\n\nStep 2: Determine the speed of the tiger\nWe can use the formula: speed = distance / time\n\nStep 3: Identify the distance and time given\nThe distance traveled by the tiger is the length of the tree trunk, which is 5 meters. The time it takes to travel this distance is 5 seconds.\n\nStep 4: Use the formula\nspeed = distance / time\nspeed = 5 meters / 5 seconds\nspeed = 1 meter per second\n\nStep 5: Apply the speed to the given information\nThe tiger is running at 1 meter per second, and its entire body passes a blade of grass in 1 second. Therefore, the time it takes for the tiger to run above the fallen tree trunk is 5 seconds.\n\nStep 6: Apply the speed to the distance traveled\nThe length of the fallen tree trunk is 5 meters. Since the tiger is running at 1 meter per second, it covers 1 meter per second * 5 seconds = 5 meters in 5 seconds.\n\nStep 7: Find the time it takes to cover the entire distance\nThe time it takes for the tiger to run above the fallen tree trunk is the time it takes to cover the entire distance divided by the speed:\n\ntime = distance / speed\ntime = 5 meters / 1 meter per second\ntime = 5 seconds\n\nTherefore, the fallen tree trunk is 5 seconds long.",
      "Step 1: Determine the speed of the tiger\nThe speed of the tiger is the distance it travels divided by the time it takes. In this case, the tiger travels a blade of grass, which is a distance of 1 meter, in 1 second. Therefore, the speed of the tiger is 1 meter / 1 second = 1 meter per second.\n\nStep 2: Determine the time the tiger takes to run above the fallen tree trunk\nThe tiger runs above the fallen tree trunk for 5 seconds. To find the time, we divide the time by the speed of the tiger. So, 5 seconds / 1 meter per second = 5 seconds.\n\nStep 3: Determine the length of the fallen tree trunk\nNow that we have the time the tiger takes to run above the tree trunk, we can find the length of the tree trunk by multiplying the time by the length of the blade of grass. So, 5 seconds * 1 meter = 5 meters.\n\nStep 4: Combine the results\nThe tiger takes 5 seconds to run above the tree trunk. The length of the tree trunk is 5 meters.

      "To find the greatest number of balls of radius 1/2 that can be placed within a rectangular box of size 10x10x1, we need to maximize the volume of the box. The volume of a rectangular box is given by the formula V = lwh, where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height of the box, respectively.\n\nLet's consider the box with dimensions 10x10x1. The volume V can be written as:\n\nV = 10l10w10h1 = 1000l10w10h1 = 1000000\n\nNow, we want to maximize the volume V. Since the volume is the area of the base (the bottom of the box) times the height (the top of the box), we can write:\n\nV = 1000000 = 1000000 = 1000000 = 1000000\n\nThis is the maximum volume, but we want to find the greatest number of balls of radius 1/2 that can be placed within the box. Since the volume is the area of the base times the height, and we want to place balls of radius 1/2, we want to maximize the area of the base.\n\nLet's consider the base of the box as a rectangle with dimensions l and w, where l = 10 and w = 10. The area of the base is then:\n\nArea = lwh = 1000000\n\nNow, we want to find the greatest number of balls of radius 1/2 that can be placed within the box. We can do this by finding the maximum number of balls that can fit within the box.\n\nSince the volume is the area of the base times the height, we can write:\n\nV = 1000000 = 1000000 = 1000000 = 1000000\n\nThis is the maximum volume, and the greatest number of balls of radius 1/2 that can be placed within the box is 1000000.",
      "To find the greatest number of balls of radius 1/2 that can be placed within a rectangular box of size 10x10x1, we need to consider the volume of the box and the number of balls that can fit within it.\n\nThe volume of the box is given by the product of its dimensions: V = 10x10x1 = 100 cubic units.\n\nSince the balls are of radius 1/2, the radius of each ball will be 1/2. We can now calculate the volume of the balls: V = 1/2x1/2x1/2 = 1 cubic unit.\n\nThe greatest number of balls of radius 1/2 that can be placed within the box is 1. This means that any more balls would not fit within the box.",
      "To find the greatest number of balls of radius $1/2$ that can be placed within a rectangular box of size $10 \\times 10 \\times 1$, we need to consider the volume of the box.\n\nThe volume of a rectangular box is given by the formula:\n\nVolume = Length \u00d7 Width \u00d7 Height\n\nIn this case, the length of the box is $10$ units, the width is $10$ units, and the height is $1$ unit.\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume:\n\nVolume = $10 \\times 10 \\times 1$ = $100$ cubic units\n\nSince the balls must be of radius $1/2$, we need to find the greatest number of balls that can fit within the box.

      "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. The trader bought a car at a certain discount on its original price. Let's denote the original price as x. The discount is given as 100% increase on the original price, which means the discount is (x - 100) or x - 100.\n\n2. When the trader sold the car, he made a profit of 60,000,000,000 (60 million) on the price he sold it for. The profit is the difference between the selling price and the original price, which is x - 100.\n\n3. Since the profit is 60,000,000,000, we can write: (x - 100) * 60,000,000,000 = 60,000,000,000.\n\n4. Simplifying the equation, we get: x - 100 = 60,000,000,000.\n\n5. Adding 100 to both sides of the equation, we get: x = 100,000,000,000 + 100.\n\n6. So, the value of x is 100,000,000,000 + 100 = 101,000,000,000.\n\n7. Now that we have the value of x, we can find the discount percentage on the original price. The discount percentage is the difference between the selling price and the original price, which is 100,000,000,000 - 101,000,000,000 = 99,000,000,000.\n\nSo, the discount percentage on the original price when the trader bought the car is 99,000,000,000."

In the given parabola, the vertex is at $(-3, 0)$. \n\nTo find the axis of symmetry, we can use the formula $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ is the coefficient of the $x^{2}$ term and $b$ is the coefficient of the $x$ term. In this case, $a = -2$ and $b = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get $x = -1/(-2) = 1/2$.\n\nNow that we have the axis of symmetry, we can find the equation of the parabola by completing the square. To do this, we can start by adding and subtracting $a^2$ inside the parenthesis of the expression. For the given parabola, we have $y = -2(1)^2 = -2$. \n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is at $(1/2, -2)$.\n\nNext, we need to shift the vertex down $1$ unit. To do this, we can subtract $h$ from the vertex coordinates. In this case, $h = 1$ (the vertical shift).\n\nFinally, we need to shift right $3$ units. To do this, we can add $k$ to the vertex coordinates. In this case, $k = 3$ (the horizontal shift).\n\nSo, the final equation of the parabola is $y = -2(1) - 1 = -3$.\n\nTherefore, the analytical expression of the parabola $y = -2x^{2}$ after shifting down $1$ unit and then shifting right $3$ units is $-3$.",
      "To find the analytical expression of the parabola $y=-2x^{2}$ after shifting down $1$ unit and then shifting right $3$ units, we need to apply the following transformations:\n\n1.

Shifting right $3$ units:\n   We start with the original equation: $y=-2x^{2}$. To shift right $3$ units, we add $3$ to the left side of the equation. This gives us: $y=-2x^{2} + 3$.\n\nNow, we combine the two shifted equations: $y=-2x^{2} - 1 + 3$. Simplifying, we get: $y=-2x^{2} + 2$.\n\nSo, the analytical expression of the parabola $y=-2x^{2}$ after shifting down $1$ unit and then shifting right $3$ units is $-2x^{2} + 2$.",

The parabola will still be in the form $y=-2x^{2}$, but shifted down by $1$.\n\nShifting right $3$ units will shift the parabola right by $3$, so the new equation will be $y=-2(x-0)^{2}+3$.\n\nNow, we can combine the shifts to find the new equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= -2(x-0)^{2}+3 \\\\\ny &= -2x^{2}+2x+3 \\\\\ny &= -2x^{2}+2x \\\\\ny &= -2x(x-1) \\\\\ny &= -2(x-1)(x+1) \\\\\ny &= -2(x-1)(x-1) \\\\\ny &= -2(x-1)^{2} \\\\\ny &= -2x^{2}+2x-2 \\\\\ny &= -2x^{2}+4x-4 \\\\\ny &= -2x^{2}+4x \\\\\ny &= -2x^{2}+4x-2 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, the analytical expression of the parabola $y=-2x^{2}$ after shifting down $1$ unit and then shifting right $3$ units is $y=-2x^{2}+4x-2$."

Since $a$ is perpendicular to $b$, the angle between $b$ and the $x$-axis is $90^\\circ - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 90^\\circ - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nSo, the smallest angle that is less than $90^\\circ - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is $90^\\circ - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 90^\\circ + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 90^\\circ + \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 90^\\circ + \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 90^\\circ + \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 90^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest angle of $\\triangle ABC$ is represented by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nInverse trigonometric functions, specifically the inverse sine function, can help us find the smallest angle. The inverse sine function, denoted as $\\sin^{-1}(x)$, returns the angle whose sine is equal to $x$. Therefore, the smallest angle is $\\sin^{-1}(90^\\circ + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\sin^{-1}(90^\\circ + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\sin^{-1}(90^\\circ + \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\sin^{-1}(90^\\circ + \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\sin^{-1}(90^\\circ + \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\sin^{-1}(90^\\circ)$.",
      "To find the smallest angle of triangle $\\triangle ABC$, we can use the Law of Sines. Let's denote the smallest angle by $\\alpha$. Then, by the Law of Sines, we have:\n\n\\frac{\\sin(a)}{\\sin(b)} = \\frac{\\sin(c)}{\\sin(\\alpha)}\n\nGiven that $a=4$, $b=3$, and $c=2$, we have:\n\n\\frac{\\sin(a)}{\\sin(3)} = \\frac{\\sin(2)}{\\sin(\\alpha)}\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\alpha$:\n\n\\frac{\\sin(a)}{\\sin(3)} = \\frac{\\sin(2)}{\\sin(\\alpha)}\n\\frac{\\sin(a)}{\\sin(3)} = \\frac{\\sin(2)}{\\sin(\\alpha)}\n\nWe can rewrite the first equation as:\n\n\\sin(3) = \\sin(2) \\cdot \\sin(a)\n\\frac{3}{\\sin(a)} = \\frac{2}{\\sin(a)}\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\sin(a)$:\n\n\\sin(a) = \\frac{2}{\\sin(3)} = \\frac{2}{\\sin(a)}\n\\sin(a) = \\frac{2}{\\sin(3)}\n\\sin(a) = \\frac{2}{\\sin(3)} = \\frac{2}{\\sin(3)} = \\frac{2}{\\sin(a)}\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\alpha$:\n\n\\sin(a) = \\frac{2}{\\sin(3)} = \\frac{2}{\\sin(a)}\n\\sin(a) = \\frac{2}{\\sin(3)} = \\frac{2}{\\sin(a)}\n\\sin(a) = \\frac{2}{\\sin(a)} = \\frac{2}{\\sin(a)}\n\nSince $\\sin(a)$ is a ratio of the side lengths of a triangle, the smallest angle of triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is represented by $\\sin^{-1}(2/2) = \\sin^{-1}(1) = 45^\\circ$."

We know that $f(-2) = 2^(-2) - 3 = 1/4 - 3 = -2/4 = -1/2$.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the value of $f(-2) + f(0)$\n\nWe have already calculated $f(-2) = -1/2$. To find $f(0)$, we simply plug in $x = 0$ into the given function:\n\n$f(0) = 2^0 - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2$.\n\nStep 6: Combine the results\n\nNow we can combine the results of the previous steps to find the value of $f(0) + f(-2)$. We have:\n\n$f(0) + f(-2) = -2 + (-1/2) = -3/2$.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{-3/2}$.",

We know that $f(x) = 2^x - 3$ for $x \\in (-2, 0)$. Since $x > 0$, we have $2^x > 0$, so $f(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in (-2, 0)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $f(x)$ on the interval $[0, 2]$. We know that $f(x) = 2^x - 3$ for $x \\in [0, 2]$. Since $x < 0$, we have $2^x < 0$, so $f(x) < 0$ for all $x \\in [0, 2]$.\n\nNow, we can find the values of $f(-2)$ and $f(0)$:\n\n$f(-2) = f(0) = 2^0 - 3 = -1$\n\n$f(-2) = f(0) = 2^0 - 3 = -1$\n\nSo, the values of $f(-2)$ and $f(0)$ are $-1$ and $-1$, respectively.\n\nNow, we can find the value of $f(-2)+f(0)$:\n\n$f(-2) + f(0) = -1 + (-1) = -2$\n\nTherefore, the value of $f(-2)+f(0)$ is $-2$.",
      "To find the value of $f(-2)+f(0)$, we first need to find the value of $f(x)$ for $x=0$. The function $f(x)$ is an odd function defined on the domain $\\mathbb{R}$, so $f(0)=0$.\n\nNow, we can plug $x=0$ into the function $f(x)$, which is given by $f(x)=2^x-3$. Plugging in $x=0$, we get:\n\n$f(0)=2^0-3$\n\n$f(0)=1-3$\n\n$f(0)=2-3$\n\n$f(0)=1$\n\nNow that we have the value of $f(0)$, we can find the value of $f(x)$ for $x>0$ by using the given formula:\n\n$f(x)=2^x-3$\n\nFor $x>0$, we have:\n\n$f(x)=2^x-3$\n\nNow, we can find $f(-2)$ by plugging in $x=-2$ into the function $f(x)$.

      "To evaluate the value of $f(-2)+f(0)$, we first need to find the values of $f(x)$ for $x > 0$ and $x < 0$.\n\nFor $x > 0$, the function $f(x)$ is given by $f(x)=2^x-3$.\n\nFor $x < 0$, the function $f(x)$ is given by $f(x)=2^(-x)$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate $f(-2)$ and $f(0)$.\n\n$f(-2)$:\n$f(-2) = 2^(-2) = 1/4$\n\n$f(0)$:\n$f(0) = 2^0 - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2$\n\nNow, we can add these two values:\n\n$f(-2) + f(0) = 1/4 + (-2) = -1/4 - 2 = -1/4 + 4 = 1/4 + 4 = 10/4 = 5/2$\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{5/2}$."

To find the value of the bond with compound interest, we can use the formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nwhere A is the final amount, P is the initial value, r is the interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years.\n\nIn this case, P = $100, r = $550/100 = 5.5%, n = 2 years, and t = 2 years.\n\nFirst, we convert the interest rate from a percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:\n\nr = (5.5% / 100) = 0.055\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n\nA = $100(1 + 0.055/2)^(2*2)\nA = $100(1 + 0.0275)^4\nA = $100(1.0275)^4\n\nStep 2: Calculate the final amount of interest\nThe final amount of interest is the difference between the bond's value and the initial value:\n\nA - P = $100(1.0275)^4 - $100\n\nStep 3: Simplify the expression\n$100(1.0275)^4 is a difficult calculation to perform by hand, so let's simplify it first:\n\n$100(1.0275)^4 = $100(1.054825)^4\n\nNow we can calculate the final amount of interest:\n\n$100(1.054825)^4 - $100 = $100(1.054825)^4 - $100(1.000131)\n\nStep 4: Calculate the final amount of interest\n$100(1.054825)^4 is approximately $271.12. Subtracting $100 from this value gives us the final amount of interest:\n\nFinal amount of interest = $271.12 - $100 = $171.12\n\nSo, Shawn received $171.12 in interest from the compound interest bond."

      "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem states that the car travels 5 kilometers to the east, but then it is recorded as 5 kilometers. To understand why this is the case, let's analyze the statement more closely.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the distance traveled in both directions\nTo understand the distance traveled in each direction, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each direction.\n\n- Traveling 5 kilometers to the east:\nDistance traveled east = Distance traveled forward + Distance traveled backward\nDistance traveled east = 5 km + 0 km (since the car is stationary and doesn't move back)\nDistance traveled east = 5 km\n\n- Traveling 5 kilometers to the west:\nDistance traveled west = Distance traveled forward - Distance traveled backward\nDistance traveled west = 5 km - 0 km (since the car is stationary and doesn't move forward)\nDistance traveled west = 5 km\n\nStep 3: Compare the distances\nNow that we have the distances traveled in both directions, we can compare them.\n\n- Traveling 5 kilometers to the east:\nDistance traveled east = 5 km\n\n- Traveling 5 kilometers to the west:\nDistance traveled west = 5 km\n\nStep 4: Express the distance traveled west as a number\nSince the distance traveled west is the same as the distance traveled east, we can express the distance traveled west as 5 km.\n\nFinal Answer: The distance traveled west is 5 kilometers.",
      "To determine how to record traveling 5 kilometers to the west, we need to consider the direction of travel. Since we are told that it is recorded as 5 kilometers, we can conclude that it is indeed 5 kilometers to the east.\n\nNow, let's consider traveling 5 kilometers to the west. To express this as a distance, we need to consider the direction again. Since we are traveling west, we are essentially moving in a direction that is 5 kilometers to the east, but with a 5-kilometer offset to the west.\n\nTo find the distance traveled in the opposite direction, we subtract the distance traveled in the eastward direction from the total distance traveled. In this case, we subtract 5 kilometers from 5 kilometers to get 0.5 kilometers.\n\nTherefore, traveling 5 kilometers to the west would be recorded as 0.5 kilometers.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of direction and how to represent it mathematically.\n\nWhen a car travels to the east, it is essentially moving in a direction that is 0 degrees (or 360 degrees) to the east. In other words, it is moving in a direction that is 0 units to the east.\n\nWhen a car travels to the west, it is essentially moving in a direction that is 180 degrees (or 270 degrees) to the west. In other words, it is moving in a direction that is 180 units to the west.\n\nSince there is no movement in the opposite direction (to the north or south), the car's position remains unchanged.\n\nSo, when a car travels 5 kilometers to the east, its new position would be 5 kilometers east.\n\nWhen a car travels 5 kilometers to the west, its new position would be 5 kilometers west.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that traveling 5 kilometers to the west would be recorded as 5 kilometers west, not 5 kilometers to the east.",

      "To determine how to record traveling 5 kilometers to the west, let's first understand what it means. When we say \"to the west,\" we mean moving to the direction opposite to the direction we are currently heading.\n\nGiven that a car travels 5 kilometers to the east, it means it is moving in the direction of the east. If we want to record this movement in the opposite direction, we need to move in the direction of the west.\n\nTo do this, we subtract the east direction from the west direction. So, the new direction would be west minus east.\n\nSo, the new direction would be 5 kilometers west."

      "Let's start by understanding the situation: the price of gasoline increases by a certain percentage, and the driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline. We want to find the percentage increase in the price of gasoline.\n\nTo do this, we first need to find the price of gasoline before the increase. We know that the price of gasoline increases by a certain percentage, which means the price will increase by that percentage. We don't know the exact percentage increase, but we can use it to find the new price.\n\nLet's say the price of gasoline before the increase is x. The price after the increase will be x + (x * (1 + percentage_increase)).\n\nSince the driver intends to spend only 10% more, the new price will be x + (x * (1 + percentage_increase) / 100).\n\nNow, we want to find the percentage increase in the price of gasoline.

      "To find the percentage increase in the price of gasoline, we first need to calculate the original price of gasoline and the percentage increase.\n\nLet's start by determining the original price of gasoline. We are told that the price of gasoline increases by a certain percentage, which means the price before the increase is 100%.\n\nTo find the original price of gasoline, we can use the formula:\n\nPrice = (Original price * Percentage increase) + Original price\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nPrice = (100% * Increase) + 100%\nPrice = Increase\n\nNow, let's find the percentage increase. We can calculate it as:\n\nPercentage increase = (Original price - New price) / Original price * 100\nPercentage increase = (100% - New price) / 100 * 100\n\nNow, let's find the New price. We are told that the driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline, so the new price would be:\n\nNew price = Original price + Increase\nNew price = 100% + Increase\n\nNow, let's find the percentage increase:\n\nPercentage increase = (New price - Original price) / Original price * 100\nPercentage increase = (100% - Original price) / 100 * 100\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage increase. We can find the new price by adding the percentage increase to the original price:\n\nNew price = Original price + Increase\nNew price = 100% + Increase\n\nNow, let's find the percentage increase:\n\nPercentage increase = (New price - Original price) / Original price * 100\nPercentage increase = (100% - Original price) / 100 * 100\n\nNow, let's put the values into the formula:\n\nPercentage increase = (100% - New price) / 100 * 100\nPercentage increase = (100% - 100%) / 100 * 100\nPercentage increase = 0%\n\nSo, the percentage increase in the price of gasoline is 0%. The driver should not reduce the quantity of gasoline that he buys.",
      "Let's analyze the situation:\n\nThe driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline, so the new price is the original price plus 10%. We want to find the percentage increase in the price of gasoline.\n\nInitially, the price of gasoline is $1.00. The driver wants to spend 10% more, so the new price is $1.00 + 10% of $1.00 = $1.00 + $0.10 = $1.10.\n\nNow, let's find the new quantity of gasoline:\n\nOriginal quantity = $1.00\nNew quantity = $1.10\n\nTo find the percentage increase in the quantity, we divide the difference (10%) by the original quantity (1.00), then multiply by 100:\n\nPercentage increase = (10%) / (1.00) * 100 = 100%\n\nSo, the percentage increase in the price of gasoline is 100%."

      "To find the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points, we need to determine the z-scores corresponding to these scores.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the z-scores for the given scores:\n\n- Score 80: z = (80 - 80) / 100 = 0\n- Score 90: z = (90 - 80) / 100 = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the area under the standard normal distribution curve between these z-scores. This area represents the probability of a student scoring between 80 and 90 points on the mathematics test.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table), we find that the probability of a student scoring between 0 and 1 standard deviation above the mean is approximately 0.3413. However, this probability includes the probability of scoring between 0 and 1 standard deviation below the mean, which is not what we want. Instead, we want to find the probability of scoring between 80 and 90.\n\nTo find this probability, we subtract the probability of scoring between 0 and 1 standard deviation above the mean from the probability of scoring between 80 and 90:\n\nProbability of scoring between 80 and 90 = 1 - Probability of scoring between 0 and 1 standard deviation above the mean\n= 1 - 0.3413\n= 0.6587\n\nSo, approximately 0.6587 or 65.87% of the students scored between 80 and 90 points on the mathematics test.",

We do this by dividing the result by the standard deviation:\n\n0.6587 / 100 = 0.006587\n\nThis represents the number of standard deviations away from the mean, which is approximately 0.6587 standard deviations.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points is approximately 0.6587.",

The probability that a score is less than or equal to a certain z-score is equal to 1 minus the probability that a score is greater than or equal to that z-score.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table, we find that:\n\nP(z \u2264 0) = 0.5 (since the total area under the standard normal curve is 1)\nP(z \u2264 0.1) = 0.8413 (since the area to the left of z = 0.1 is approximately 0.8413)\n\nSo, the probability that a student scored between 80 and 90 points is:\n\nP(z \u2264 0.1) = 0.8413\n\nNow, we can find the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points by multiplying the probability by the total number of students:\n\nNumber of students = P(z \u2264 0.1) * Total number of students\n= 0.8413 * 48\n= 40.04\n\nTherefore, approximately 40.04 students scored between 80 and 90 points.",

So, the left-hand side becomes $-128 - 32 - 8 - 2 = 120$.\n\nNow, we can substitute $-2$ for $x$ in the equation:\n\n$F(-2) = a(-2)^7 + b(-2)^5 + c(-2)^3 + d - 6$\n\n$F(-2) = a(128) + b(-32) + c(-8) + d - 6$\n\n$F(-2) = -128a + 32b - 8c - d + 6$\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $F(2)$ by substituting $x = 2$ in the equation:\n\n$F(2) = -128a + 32b - 8c - d + 6$\n\nTo find $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, we can use the fact that $F(x) = ax^7 + bx^5 + cx^3 + dx - 6$ and $F(-2) = 10$. Let's use the second equation:\n\n$F(2) = -128a + 32b - 8c - d + 6$\n\n$F(2) = -128(2) + 32(5) - 8(2) - 6$\n\n$F(2) = -256 + 160 - 16 - 6$\n\n$F(2) = 10$\n\nSo, the value of $F(2)$ is $10$.",

      "To find the value of $F(2)$, we first need to find the value of $F(-2)$. We do this by substituting $-2$ into the given function $F(x) = ax^7 + bx^5 + cx^3 + dx - 6$.\n\nWe have $F(-2) = a(-2)^7 + b(-2)^5 + c(-2)^3 + d - 6$. To simplify this expression, we'll use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\[\na(-2)^7 = -2a^7\n\\]and \\[\nb(-2)^5 = -2b^5\n\\]and \\[\nc(-2)^3 = -2c^3\n\\]and \\[\nd = -6\n\\]\n\nNow we can write \\[\nF(-2) = -2a^7 + b(-2)^5 + c(-2)^3 + d\n\\]or \\[\nF(-2) = -2(-2)^7 + b(-2)^5 + c(-2)^3 + d\n\\]or \\[\nF(-2) = -2(16) + b(-8) + c(-4) + d\n\\]\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n-2a^7 &= -2(16) \\\\\n-2b^5 &= -8b \\\\\n-2c^3 &= -4c \\\\\nd &= 1\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by first adding the two equations together.

Now, we can use Vieta's formulas to find the values of $a$ and $b$.\n\n$$a = -b$$\n\n$$b = -a$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $a+b$ is:\n\n$$a+b = -b + a = -a - b = -a + b = -b + (-a) = -a + a = a - b$$\n\nSo, the value of $a+b$ is:\n\n$$a + b = a - b = a - b = -a + b = -a + b$$\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$$a+b = -a + b = -a + b = -a + b = -a + b$$",

      "To solve this problem, let's first consider the cost price and selling price of the article. We know that the selling price had increased by $500, which means the selling price is $1250 + $500 = $1750.\n\nWe also know that the loss percentage was 15%. This means that for every $1 of the selling price, the tradesman lost 15% of the $1250.\n\nTo find the cost price, we can set up the equation:\n\n(1 - 0.15) * 1250 = 1250\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equation:\n\n0.85 * 1250 = 1250\n\nNow, let's calculate 0.85 * 1250:\n\n1062.5 = 1250\n\nTo find the cost price, we divide both sides of the equation by 1062.5:\n\n1250 / 1062.5 = 1250 / 1062.5\n\nThis simplifies to 1.0085, which means the cost price is approximately $1.01.\n\nNow that we have the cost price, we can find the loss percentage by dividing the selling price by the cost price:\n\n(1750 - 1250) / 1250 = 500 / 1250\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 25:\n\n10 / 15 = 2 / 3\n\nSo, the loss percentage is 20%.\n\nTherefore, the loss percentage when the article was initially sold was 20%.",

To find the loss percentage, we'll use the following formula:\n\nLoss percentage = (Gain percentage * (Original selling price - Cost price)) / Cost price\n\nLoss percentage = (15% * (1250 - $1250)) / $1250\nLoss percentage = (15% * $1250) / $1250\nLoss percentage = 0.25 * $1250\nLoss percentage = $312.50\n\nStep 3: Convert the loss percentage to a percentage.\nNow that we have the loss percentage, we can convert it to a percentage by multiplying by 100.\nLoss percentage = 0.25 * 100\nLoss percentage = 25%\n\nSo, the original selling price was $1250, and the loss percentage was 25%.",

We know that the selling price was increased by $500, and the initial selling price was $1250. We can set up an equation based on this information:\n\nInitial selling price - Increased selling price = (Initial selling price - Cost price) * Loss percentage\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n$1250 - $500 = ($1250 - $1250) * Loss percentage\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n$750 = Loss percentage * $1250\n\nStep 2: Solve for the loss percentage\nNow, we can solve for the loss percentage by dividing both sides of the equation by $1250:\nLoss percentage = $750 / $1250\nLoss percentage \u2248 0.6\n\nSo, the loss percentage is approximately 60%. This means that for every $1250 sold, the tradesman lost approximately $60.",

The selling price of the article had been increased by $500, which is 50% of the original selling price.\n3. The new selling price is $1250, and the original selling price was $1250.\n4. We can set up the equation: (Original selling price - New selling price) / Original selling price = (New selling price - Original selling price) / New selling price * 100.\n5. Substituting the values, we get: (1250 - 500) / 1250 * 100 = (650 / 1250) * 100.\n6. Simplifying the equation: (1250 - 500) / 1250 * 100 = 750 / 1250 * 100.\n7. Multiplying the fractions, we get: (1250 - 500) / 1250 * 100 = (750 / 1250) * 100.\n8. To find the loss percentage, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: (750 / 1250) * 100 = 0.6 (or 60%).\n\nSo, the loss percentage when the article was initially sold is 60%."

      "To find the equation of a line that is $5$ units below the original line $y=2x+3$, we can use the concept of slope-intercept form. The slope-intercept form of a line is given by $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\nThe slope of the original line is $m=2$, and the y-intercept is $b=3$. Since the slope-intercept form of the original line is $y=2x+3$, we can rewrite it as $y=2x+3-3$, which simplifies to $y=2x$.\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the line that is $5$ units below the original line. To do this, we subtract $5$ from $2$: $m=2-5=(-2)$. Therefore, the slope of the line that is $5$ units below the original line is $m=-2$.\n\nFinally, we can use the slope-intercept form to write the equation of the new line. We have $y=2x-3$. To find the y-intercept, we add $3$ to both sides: $y=2x$. The resulting equation is $y=2x+3$.\n\nSo, the equation of the line that is $5$ units below the original line is $y=2x+3$.",
