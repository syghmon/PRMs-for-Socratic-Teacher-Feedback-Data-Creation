      "1. Let's denote the trapezoid as $ABCD$, where $AB \\parallel CD$ and $AB = c$ and $CD = d$.\n\n2. Consider the trapezoid divided into two smaller trapezoids by the line parallel to the bases $AB$ and $CD$. Let the bases of these smaller trapezoids be $x$ and $y$.\n\n3. The radius of the inscribed circle in each of the smaller trapezoids is equal to the distance from the vertex of the smaller trapezoid to the line parallel to the bases.

The height of the larger trapezoid is $AB + CD$, and the radius of the inscribed circle in the larger trapezoid is $\\frac{CD - AB}{2}$.\n\n5.

      "1. Let's denote the trapezoid as \\(ABCD\\) with bases \\(AD\\) and \\(BC\\). Let the line parallel to the bases that splits the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids be \\(EF\\).\n2. Given that \\(AD = c\\) and \\(BC = d\\), we need to find the bases \\(AD\\) and \\(BC\\) of the original trapezoid.\n3. Let \\(AD = x\\) and \\(BC = y\\). Since the line \\(EF\\) splits the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids, the two smaller trapezoids are \\(EBDC\\) and \\(ABCF\\).\n4. The line \\(EF\\) is parallel to the bases \\(AD\\) and \\(BC\\). Therefore, the angles \\(\\angle EDF\\) and \\(\\angle EBC\\) are equal, as they are corresponding angles.\n5. In the smaller trapezoid \\(EBDC\\), the angle \\(\\angle EDF\\) is equal to the angle \\(\\angle EBC\\). Hence, \\(\\angle EDF = \\angle EBC\\).\n6. Since \\(\\angle EDF = \\angle EBC\\), the line \\(EF\\) is parallel to the bases of the smaller trapezoid \\(EBDC\\).\n7. Since \\(EF\\) is parallel to \\(AD\\) and \\(BC\\), we have \\(AD = x\\) and \\(BC = y\\).\n8. The line \\(EF\\) also divides the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids, each of which can have a circle inscribed in it. This implies that the triangles formed by the diagonals of these smaller trapezoids are similar.\n9. The triangles \\(AEB\\) and \\(FEC\\) are similar because they share the same angle at \\(E\\) and are right triangles.\n10. Using the similarity of the triangles, we have the proportion \\( \\frac{AE}{EB} = \\frac{EF}{EC}\\).\n11. Given that \\(AE = AC\\) (since \\(AE\\) is the height of the trapezoid \\(ABCD\\)), we can write \\( \\frac{c}{AD - c} = \\frac{EF}{EC}\\).\n12. Substituting \\(AD = x\\) and \\(BC = y\\) into the equation, we have \\( \\frac{c}{x - c} = \\frac{EF}{y}\\).\n13. To find \\(EF\\), we need to express it in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).

      "Let's consider the given right trapezoid with bases $a$ and $b$. The line parallel to the bases splits it into two smaller trapezoids, each with an inscribed circle. We need to find the bases of the original trapezoid, given that the lateral sides are equal to $c$ and $d$, where $c<d$.\n\n1. The two smaller trapezoids have bases $a$ and $b$, and the line parallel to the bases splits the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids. Let's call the smaller trapezoid with bases $a$ and $b$ as $\\triangle ABC$ and the larger trapezoid with bases $c$ and $d$ as $\\triangle ABD$.\n\n2. The line parallel to the bases of $\\triangle ABC$ splits it into two smaller trapezoids, each with an inscribed circle. We can see that the line parallel to the bases of $\\triangle ABD$ will also split $\\triangle ABD$ into two smaller trapezoids.\n\n3. Since the line parallel to the bases splits both $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle ABD$ into smaller trapezoids, the line will also split the original trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids. Let's call these smaller trapezoids $\\triangle ACD$ and $\\triangle BCD$.\n\n4. Now, we know that the line parallel to the bases of the original trapezoid will split it into two smaller trapezoids, each with an inscribed circle. Since the line parallel to the bases of $\\triangle ABD$ splits $\\triangle ABD$ into two smaller trapezoids, the same line will split the original trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids.\n\n5.

The radii of the inscribed circles in each of the smaller trapezoids are equal to the distance between the parallel sides of the trapezoid. Let's denote this distance as $y$.\n\n7. Since the line parallel to the bases splits the original trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids, the sum of the areas of the smaller trapezoids must be equal to the area of the original trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{Base}_1 + \\text{Base}_2) \\times \\text{Height} \\]\n\nFor the original trapezoid:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area}_{\\triangle ABD} = \\frac{1}{2} (a + b) \\times h \\]\n\nFor the smaller trapezoids $\\triangle ACD$ and $\\triangle BCD$:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area}_{\\triangle ACD} = \\frac{1}{2} (c - x + h - x) \\times (h - x) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area}_{\\triangle BCD} = \\frac{1}{2} (d + x + h + x) \\times (h + x) \\]\n\n8.

Let \\(A_1\\) and \\(B_1\\) be the points where the line parallel to the bases intersects the top and bottom bases of the trapezoid, respectively.\n4. Since the line is parallel to the bases, triangles \\(AA_1B_1\\) and \\(CDB_1\\) are similar.\n5. The ratio of the corresponding sides of these triangles is equal, so we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a-d}{a} = \\frac{b}{c+d}\n   \\]\n6.

For $\\overset{\u2192}{PA}$, since $P$ is on side $BC$, the coordinates of $P$ are $(x, 0)$. For $\\overset{\u2192}{PB}$, since $P$ is on side $AC$, the coordinates of $P$ are $(0, y)$. Thus, $|\\overset{\u2192}{PA}| = |x|$ and $|\\overset{\u2192}{PB}| = |y|$.\n\n4. **Calculate the dot product**: Substituting the magnitudes of $\\overset{\u2192}{PA}$ and $\\overset{\u2192}{PB}$ into the dot product formula, we get $\\overset{\u2192}{PA} \\cdot \\overset{\u2192}{PB} = |x| |y| = |xy|$.\n\n5. **Determine the minimum value of the dot product**: The dot product of two vectors is minimized when the two vectors are parallel and in the same direction.

The minimum value of $x$ and $y$ is 0, which means the minimum value of $|\\overset{\u2192}{PA} \\cdot \\overset{\u2192}{PB}|$ is $|0 \\cdot 0| = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $\\overset{\u2192}{PA} \\cdot \\overset{\u2192}{PB}$ for any point $P$ on the sides of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\boxed{0}$.",

      "To find the coefficient of $x^3y^3$ in the expansion of $(x+2y)(2x-y)^5$, we will use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that the expansion of $(a+b)^n$ is given by:\n\n$$(a+b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k}b^k$$\n\nIn our case, we have $(x+2y)$ and $(2x-y)^5$.

      "To find the discount percentage on the original price when the trader bought the car, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the original price of the car:\n   The trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price, which means the profit is 60.00000000000001% of the original price. So, the profit can be calculated as follows:\n   Profit = (60.00000000000001 / 100) * Original Price\n   Profit = 0.6 * Original Price\n\n2. The trader sold the car at a 100% increase on the price he bought it. This means the selling price is double the price he bought it for. So, the selling price can be calculated as follows:\n   Selling Price = 2 * (Original Price - Discount)\n   Selling Price = 2 * (Original Price - Discount)\n\n3. We know that the profit is the difference between the selling price and the original price:\n   Profit = Selling Price - Original Price\n   Profit = 2 * (Original Price - Discount) - Original Price\n   Profit = 2 * (Original Price - Discount) - Original Price\n\n4. According to the problem, the profit is 60.00000000000001% of the original price, which can be written as:\n   Profit = 0.6 * Original Price\n   So, we have:\n   2 * (Original Price - Discount) - Original Price = 0.6 * Original Price\n   Multiplying both sides by 2:\n   2 * Original Price - 2 * Discount = 0.6 * Original Price\n\n5.

      "To find the value of a such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) holds true for any x in the interval (0, \u03c0), we can start by expressing f(x+a) and f(x+3a) in terms of the original function f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4).\n\nFirst, let's express f(x+a) and f(x+3a):\n\nf(x+a) = sin(2(x+a) - \u03c0/4) = sin(2x + 2a - \u03c0/4)\nf(x+3a) = sin(2(x+3a) - \u03c0/4) = sin(2x + 6a - \u03c0/4)\n\nNow, we want to find the value of a such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a).

This means that the sine function has the same value at x = \u03c0/4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the equation sin(2x + 2a - \u03c0/4) = sin(2x + 6a - \u03c0/4) further. Since the sine function is periodic with a period of 2\u03c0, we can write:\n\n2a - \u03c0/4 = 2x + 6a - \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0k\n\nwhere k is an integer.

      "1. Let's start by determining the area of the parallelogram $ABCD$. Since the parallelogram has an area of $S$, we can find the length of each side of the parallelogram using the formula for the area of a parallelogram: Area = base \u00d7 height.\n\n2. Let's assume that $AB = a$ and $AD = b$. The height of the parallelogram is the perpendicular distance between the base $AB$ and the side $CD$.\n\n3. The area of the parallelogram can be expressed as $S = a \\cdot h$. Given that $S = ab$, we have:\n\n\\[ab = a \\cdot h\\]\n\n\\[h = \\frac{ab}{a} = b\\]\n\n4. Now, let's find the area of the triangle $\\triangle MCD$. The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = $\\frac{1}{2}$ base \u00d7 height.\n\n5. Since $CD$ is a side of the parallelogram, the height of the triangle $\\triangle MCD$ is the same as the height of the parallelogram, which is $b$. The base of the triangle $\\triangle MCD$ is the length of $MC$, which can be found using the cosine rule in $\\triangle ABM$.\n\n6. Applying the cosine rule in $\\triangle ABM$, we get:\n\n\\[MC = \\sqrt{AB^2 + BM^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BM \\cdot \\cos(180^\\circ - \\angle ABM)} = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + 2ab \\cdot \\cos(180^\\circ - \\angle ABM)}\\]\n\n7. Since $\\cos(180^\\circ - \\angle ABM) = -\\cos(\\angle ABM)$, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[MC = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(\\angle ABM)}\\]\n\n8. The area of the triangle $\\triangle MCD$ is given by:\n\n\\[S_{\\triangle MCD} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot MC \\cdot b = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(\\angle ABM)} \\cdot b\\]\n\n9. We need to find the probability that the area of $\\triangle MCD$ is less than $\\frac{S}{3}$. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(\\angle ABM)} \\cdot b < \\frac{ab}{3}\\]\n\n10. Simplifying the inequality, we get:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(\\angle ABM)} < \\frac{ab}{6}\\]\n\n11. Squaring both sides of the inequality, we obtain:\n\n\\[a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(\\angle ABM) < \\frac{a^2b^2}{36}\\]\n\n12. Subtracting $a^2$ and $b^2$ from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[-2ab \\cdot \\cos(\\angle ABM) < \\frac{a^2b^2}{36} - \\frac{a^2b^2}{36}\\]\n\n\\[-2ab \\cdot \\cos(\\angle ABM) < \\frac{ab^2}{72}\\]\n\n13. Dividing both sides by $-2ab$, we obtain:\n\n\\[\\cos(\\angle ABM) > \\frac{ab}{72}\\]\n\n14. Since $0^\\circ < \\angle ABM < 180^\\circ$, the cosine function is positive in this range. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\n\\[\\angle ABM > \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{ab}{72}\\right)\\]\n\n15. The probability that the area of $\\triangle MCD$ is less than $\\frac{S}{3}$ is given by the ratio of the favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. The favorable outcomes are the points $M$ within the parallelogram such that the area of $\\triangle MCD$ is less than $\\frac{S}{3}$. The total number of outcomes is the total area of the parallelogram, which is $S$.\n\n16. Therefore, the probability is:\n\n\\[\\frac{S_{\\triangle MCD}}{S",

      "To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given information and applying the properties of arithmetic and geometric sequences.\n\n1. Since $\\{a_{n}\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote this common difference by $d$.\n\n2. We are also given that the terms $a_1$, $a_3$, and $a_9$ form a geometric sequence. By the definition of a geometric sequence, the ratio between any two consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote this common ratio by $r$. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_9}{a_3} = r\n   \\]\n\n3. Since $a_1$ is the first term of the sequence, we can write $a_1 = a_1$. Similarly, $a_3 = a_1 + 2d$ and $a_9 = a_1 + 8d$. Substituting these into the equations for the geometric sequence gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a_1 + 2d}{a_1} = r \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{a_1 + 8d}{a_1 + 2d} = r\n   \\]\n\n4.

Now, we need to find the ratio $\\frac{a_1 + a_3 + a_9}{a_2 + a_4 + a_{10}}$. Substituting the expressions for $a_3$ and $a_9$ from step 3, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a_1 + a_1 + 2d + a_1 + a_1 + 7d}{a_1 + a_1 + 2d + a_1 + a_1 + 8d}\n   \\]\n\n6. Simplifying this expression, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3a_1 + 9d}{3a_1 + 10d}\n   \\]\n\n7.

We can now use the property of geometric sequences to express $\\frac{9d}{a_1}$ and $\\frac{10d}{a_1}$ in terms of $r$:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9d}{a_1} = 9r \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{10d}{a_1} = 10r\n   \\]\n\n9. Substituting these into the simplified expression, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3 + 9r}{3 + 10r}\n   \\]\n\n10. Simplifying the fraction further, we find:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{3 + 9r}{3 + 10r} = \\frac{3(1 + 3r)}{3(1 + 3r)} = \\frac{1 + 3r}{1 + 3r} = 1\n    \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.",

In this case, the standard deviation is:\n\n$\\sqrt{100} = 10$\n\nStep 3: Calculate the z-scores for 80 and 90.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\n$z = \\frac{X - \u03bc}{\\sigma}$\n\nFor $X = 80$:\n\n$z = \\frac{80 - 80}{10} = 0$\n\nFor $X = 90$:\n\n$z = \\frac{90 - 80}{10} = 1$\n\nStep 4: Calculate the area under the normal curve between z-scores of 0 and 1.\n\nThe area under the normal curve between z-scores of 0 and 1 is approximately 0.3413.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points.\n\nSince there are 48 students in the class, the number of students who scored between 80 and 90 points is:\n\n48 * 0.3413 \u2248 15.652\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, approximately 16 students scored between 80 and 90 points.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{16}"

      "Let's reason through this problem step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to find the cost price of the article. We are given that the cost price of the article is $1250.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the loss percentage when the article was initially sold. We know that if the selling price had been increased by $500, there would have been a gain of 15%. Let's denote the original selling price as \"S\" and the original cost price as \"C\".\n\n3. The original selling price (S) would have been S = C + $500.\n\n4. We also know that if the selling price had been increased by $500, there would have been a gain of 15%. This means that the new selling price would have been S + $500 = C + $500 + 15% of C.\n\n5. We can express the 15% gain as a decimal by dividing by 100: 15% = 0.15.\n\n6. Therefore, the new selling price would be S + $500 = C + $500 + 0.15C.\n\n7. We can combine the terms involving C: S + $500 = 1.15C.\n\n8. We can express the cost price (C) in terms of the selling price (S): C = S - $500.\n\n9. Substituting this expression for C into the equation from step 7, we get S + $500 = 1.15(S - $500).\n\n10. Expanding the right side of the equation, we get S + $500 = S + $575 - 1.15S.\n\n11. Simplifying the equation by combining like terms, we get $75 = -0.15S.\n\n12. Solving for S, we find S = $75 / -0.15 = $500.\n\n13. Now that we have the original selling price (S), we can find the original cost price (C). We know that S = C + $500.\n\n14. So, C = S - $500 = $500 - $500 = $0.\n\n15.

If S = $500, then C = $500 - $500 = $0.\n\n20. However, this doesn't make sense because the cost price cannot be zero.\n\n21. We must have made another error in our calculations.

We can use the following formula to find the new selling price:\n\nNew selling price = Original selling price + Increase\nNew selling price = $1250 + $500\nNew selling price = $1750\n\nNow, we know that a 15% gain results in a new selling price of $1750.

    "final_answer": "60",
    "responses": [
      "Let's denote the percentage by which y is less than z as P%.\n\nStep 1: We know that x is 20% more than y. This means x is 120% of y. So, we can write the equation as:\n\nx = y + 0.20y\nx = 1.20y\n\nStep 2: We are also given that x is 48% of z. So, we can write the equation as:\n\nx = 0.48z\n\nStep 3: Now we can equate the two expressions for x:\n\n1.20y = 0.48z\n\nStep 4: To find the percentage decrease of y compared to z, we need to find the difference between y and z, and then express it as a percentage of z. So, we can write the equation as:\n\ny - z = (1 - 0.48)z\ny - z = 0.52z\n\nStep 5: Now, we can express the difference as a percentage of z:\n\n((y - z)/z) * 100% = 0.52 * 100%\n= 52%\n\nSo, y is 52% less than z. To find the percentage decrease of y compared to z, we subtract this percentage from 100%:\n\n100% - 52% = 48%\n\nTherefore, y is 48% less than z.",
      "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. We know that x is 20 percent more than y. This can be written as:\nx = y + 0.20y\nx = 1.20y\n\n2. We also know that x is 48 percent of z. This can be written as:\nx = 0.48z\n\nNow we can set the two equations equal to each other since they both equal x:\n1.20y = 0.48z\n\n3. To find the percentage decrease of y compared to z, we need to find the difference between y and z, then divide that by z, and finally multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nFirst, let's find the difference between y and z:\nDifference = z - y\n\nNow we can divide the difference by z and multiply by 100:\nPercentage Decrease = (Difference / z) * 100\n\nSubstitute the values we found from step 3 into this equation:\nPercentage Decrease = ((z - y) / z) * 100\n\nSubstitute the values from step 2 into this equation:\nPercentage Decrease = ((0.48z / z) * 100)\n\nSince z is in both the numerator and the denominator, it cancels out:\nPercentage Decrease = (0.48 * 100)\n\nNow, let's calculate the final answer:\nPercentage Decrease = 48%\n\nSo, y is $\\boxed{48}$  percent less than z.",
      "Step 1: Let's start by expressing the relationship between x, y, and z using variables.

However, since we already know that x is 48 percent of z, we can directly conclude that y is 52 percent of z (because 100 percent - 48 percent = 52 percent).\n\nStep 5: Now we can find the percentage decrease of y compared to z. This can be done by subtracting the percentage of z that y represents from 100 percent:\n\n100% - 52% = 48%\n\nSo, y is 48 percent less than z.\n\nFinal answer: y is $\\boxed{48\\%}$  less than z.",

If x is 48 percent of z, we can express this as:\n\n1.20y = 0.48z\n\nNow we need to find out what percent less y is compared to z. To do this, we can rearrange the equation from step 2 to solve for y:\n\ny = (0.48z) / 1.20\ny = 0.4z\n\nThis means that y is 40 percent of z. So, y is 40 percent less than z.\n\nTo find the percentage decrease of y compared to z, we can calculate the percentage decrease of y compared to y's original value:\n\nPercentage decrease = (Original value of y - New value of y) / Original value of y * 100\n\nPercentage decrease = (1 - 0.4) * 100\nPercentage decrease = 0.6 * 100\nPercentage decrease = 60%\n\nSo, y is 60 percent less than z.",
      "Let's denote the percentage decrease of y compared to z as P%.\n\nStep 1: Determine the relationship between x and z.\nSince x is 48% of z, we can write the equation:\nx = 0.48z\n\nStep 2: Determine the relationship between x and y.\nSince x is 20% more than y, we can write the equation:\nx = y + 0.20y\nx = 1.20y\n\nStep 3: Set the two equations equal to each other.\nSince x is equal to 1.20y, we can substitute 1.20y for x in the equation from step 2:\n1.20y = 1.20y\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, there is no solution for y. This means that y cannot be found independently.\n\nHowever, since we know that x is 48% of z, we can conclude that y is some percentage less than z.\n\nStep 5: Determine the percentage decrease of y compared to z.\nTo find the percentage decrease, we need to know the value of P%. Since y is not found independently, we cannot determine the exact percentage decrease.\n\nFinal Answer: The percentage decrease of y compared to z cannot be determined with the given information."

    "problem": "It takes Matt 2 minutes per problem to do his math homework with a calculator and a certain amount of time per problem without a calculator. If Matt's assignment has 20 problems, using a calculator will save him 60 minutes. How many minutes does it take Matt to do a problem without a calculator?",

      "Let's denote the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator as \\( x \\) minutes.\n\nFirst, we know that using a calculator saves Matt 60 minutes. This means that the time it takes Matt to do the problems without a calculator is 60 minutes more than the time it takes him with a calculator.\n\nThe time it takes Matt with a calculator is \\( 2x \\) minutes because he spends 2 minutes per problem.\n\nSo, the equation for the time it takes Matt with a calculator is:\n\\[ 2x = 60 + x \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\):\n\nStep 1: Subtract \\( x \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2x - x = 60 \\]\n\nStep 2: Simplify the equation:\n\\[ x = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Matt \\( $\\boxed{60}$  \\) minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Step 1: Determine the time saved by using a calculator.\nMatt saves 60 minutes by using a calculator.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the time saved per problem.\nTo find the time saved per problem, we divide the total time saved by the number of problems:\n60 minutes \u00f7 20 problems = 3 minutes per problem.\n\nStep 3: Determine the time it takes to do a problem without a calculator.\nSince Matt saves 3 minutes per problem with a calculator, he must take 3 minutes longer without a calculator to do the same amount of work.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the time it takes to do a problem without a calculator.\nTo find the time it takes to do a problem without a calculator, we add the time saved per problem to the time it takes without a calculator:\n3 minutes (saved) + 3 minutes (without a calculator) = 6 minutes per problem.\n\nTherefore, it takes Matt 6 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Step 1: Determine the total time it takes Matt to do the assignment without using a calculator.\n\nSince Matt's assignment has 20 problems, and he can do one problem in 2 minutes without a calculator, we can calculate the total time as follows:\n\nTotal time = Number of problems * Time per problem without calculator\nTotal time = 20 problems * 2 minutes/problem\nTotal time = 40 minutes\n\nStep 2: Calculate the time it takes Matt to do the assignment with a calculator.\n\nWe know that using a calculator will save Matt 60 minutes. So, the time it takes Matt to do the assignment with a calculator is:\n\nTime with calculator = Total time - Time saved\nTime with calculator = 40 minutes - 60 minutes\nTime with calculator = -20 minutes\n\nThis means that using a calculator will actually make Matt spend more time on his assignment than without a calculator. This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the information.\n\nStep 3: Re-evaluate the information.\n\nIf using a calculator saves Matt 60 minutes, and the total time without using a calculator is 40 minutes, then we can re-calculate the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator:\n\nTime per problem without calculator = Total time without calculator / Number of problems\nTime per problem without calculator = 40 minutes / 20 problems\nTime per problem without calculator = 2 minutes\n\nSo, it takes Matt 2 minutes per problem without a calculator.",
      "Step 1: Determine the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator.\n\nLet's denote the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator as \\( T \\) minutes.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total time it takes Matt to do his assignment with a calculator.\n\nWith a calculator, Matt can do 20 problems in 2 minutes per problem, so the total time is \\( 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\) minutes.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total time it takes Matt to do his assignment without a calculator.\n\nWithout a calculator, Matt can do 20 problems in \\( T \\) minutes.\n\nStep 4: Set up the equation to find the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator.\n\nThe difference in time between doing a problem with and without a calculator is 60 minutes. So we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 40 - T = 60 \\]\n\nStep 5: Solve for \\( T \\).\n\nFirst, add \\( T \\) to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( T \\):\n\n\\[ 40 = 60 + T \\]\n\nNext, subtract 60 from both sides to solve for \\( T \\):\n\n\\[ T = 60 - 40 \\]\n\n\\[ T = 20 \\]\n\nSo, it takes Matt $\\boxed{20}$  minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
      "Step 1: Let's denote the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator as x minutes.\n\nStep 2: Matt's time with and without a calculator is given as 2 minutes per problem with a calculator and x minutes per problem without a calculator.\n\nStep 3: The total time taken to do the assignment with a calculator is 20 problems * 2 minutes per problem = 40 minutes.\n\nStep 4: The total time taken to do the assignment without a calculator is 20 problems * x minutes per problem = 20x minutes.\n\nStep 5: According to the problem, using a calculator will save Matt 60 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation as: 40 minutes (with a calculator) - 60 minutes (without a calculator) = 20x minutes (without a calculator).\n\nStep 6: Solving for x, we get: 20x = 60 - 40, which simplifies to: 20x = 20.\n\nStep 7: Dividing both sides by 20, we get: x = 20 / 20 = 1 minute.\n\nSo, it takes Matt 1 minute to do a problem without a calculator."
