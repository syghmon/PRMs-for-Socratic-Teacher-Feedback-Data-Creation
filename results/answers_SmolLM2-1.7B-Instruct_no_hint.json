The radius of the inscribed circle in a trapezoid can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{a + b - c}{2}\n   \\]\n\n6. Since the trapezoids are similar, the ratio of their heights (the perpendicular distance from the bases to the midpoint of the non-parallel sides) is the same as the ratio of their bases. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{AD'}{BC'} = \\frac{AB'}{B'C'}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given lateral sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{a}{b}\n   \\]\n   From this, we can express \\(a\\) in terms of \\(b\\):\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{b}{d} \\cdot c\n   \\]\n\n7.

      "1. Let's denote the trapezoid as $ABCD$ with bases $BC$ and $AD$.\n2. The line parallel to the bases divides the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids, each of which can have a circle inscribed in it. This implies that the line is the midline of the trapezoid, as the bases of the smaller trapezoids will be equal to the bases of the original trapezoid.\n3. The midline of a trapezoid divides it into two triangles of equal area.\n4. Let $E$ be the midpoint of $BC$, and $F$ be the midpoint of $AD$.\n5. The area of the trapezoid $ABCD$ can be expressed as the sum of the areas of the two triangles $BEC$ and $CED$.\n6. The area of each triangle can be calculated as $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. Since the bases of the smaller trapezoids are equal to the bases of the original trapezoid, we can use the ratio of the areas of the smaller trapezoids to find the height of each triangle.\n7. The height of each triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{base of the original trapezoid}) \\times (\\text{height of the smaller trapezoid})$.\n8. The height of the smaller trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{height of the original trapezoid})$.\n9. The area of the trapezoid $ABCD$ can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_{ABCD} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{base of the original trapezoid}) \\times (\\text{height of the smaller trapezoid}) + \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{base of the original trapezoid}) \\times (\\text{height of the smaller trapezoid})\n   \\]\n10. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_{ABCD} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2(\\text{height of the smaller trapezoid}) = \\text{height of the smaller trapezoid}\n   \\]\n11. Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is equal to the height of the smaller trapezoid.\n12. The area of the trapezoid $ABCD$ can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of the two smaller trapezoids:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_{ABCD} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{base of the original trapezoid}) \\times (\\text{height of the smaller trapezoid}) + \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{base of the original trapezoid}) \\times (\\text{height of the smaller trapezoid})\n   \\]\n13.

Since the area of the trapezoid is equal to the height of the smaller trapezoid, we have:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\text{height of the smaller trapezoid} = 2 \\times \\text{height of the smaller trapezoid}\n   \\]\n15. This equation holds true for any trapezoid, which means the ratio of the areas of the smaller trapezoids is equal to the ratio of the bases of the original trapezoid.\n16. The ratio of the bases of the original trapezoid to the height of the smaller trapezoid is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio of bases} = \\frac{c}{d}\n   \\]\n17. Since the ratio of the bases of the original trapezoid to the height of the smaller trapezoid is equal to the ratio of the bases of the smaller trapezoids to the height of the smaller trapezoid, we can conclude that:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{c_1}{d_1}\n   \\]\n18. Solving for the bases of the original trapezoid, we get:\n   \\[\n   c_1 = c, \\quad d_1 = d\n   \\]\n19. Therefore, the bases of the original trapezoid are $c$ and $d$.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{c, d}",

      "1. Consider the trapezoid ABCD, where AB is the shorter base, CD is the longer base, and AD and BC are the legs.\n\n2. The line through the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (AD and BC) is parallel to the bases AB and CD. Let's call this line EF.\n\n3. The circle inscribed in the trapezoid is tangent to both bases. Therefore, the radius of the inscribed circle is equal to the distance from the center of the circle to the bases. Let's denote this distance by r.\n\n4. Since the circle is tangent to the bases, the line joining the center of the circle to the base is perpendicular to the base. Let's call this line GH.\n\n5. The trapezoid ABCD can be divided into two smaller trapezoids (ABGH and CDGH) by the line EF. These smaller trapezoids are similar to the original trapezoid ABCD.\n\n6. The similarity ratio between the smaller trapezoids and the original trapezoid is (AB + CD) / (AD + BC).\n\n7. The ratio of the bases of the smaller trapezoids (ABGH and CDGH) is also the ratio of their bases (AB and CD).\n\n8. Since the circles are inscribed in both smaller trapezoids, the radius of the inscribed circles in these trapezoids is the same.\n\n9. Let's denote the radius of the inscribed circle in the smaller trapezoid ABCGH as r1 and the radius of the inscribed circle in the smaller trapezoid CDGH as r2.\n\n10. The ratio of the radii of the inscribed circles in the smaller trapezoids is the same as the ratio of their bases. Therefore, r1 / r2 = (AB + CD) / (AD + BC).\n\n11. We know that AB = c and CD = d. Therefore, r1 / r2 = (c + d) / (c + d).\n\n12. Since the ratio of the radii of the inscribed circles is the same as the ratio of the bases of the trapezoids, we can write: r1 / r2 = (c + d) / (c + d) = 1.\n\n13. This means that the radius of the inscribed circle in both smaller trapezoids is equal to r.\n\n14. Since the inscribed circles are tangent to the bases of the trapezoids, the distance from the center of the circle to the bases is equal to r.\n\n15. Let's denote the distance from the center of the circle to the bases of the original trapezoid as r.\n\n16. We know that the distance from the center of the circle to the bases is also the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\n17. Therefore, the distance from the center of the circle to the bases is r.\n\n18.

Recall the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in its general form:\n\\[\n(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\ldots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \\ldots + b_n^2) \\geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \\ldots + a_nb_n)^2\n\\]\nwhere the equality holds if and only if \\(a_1 = a_2 = \\ldots = a_n\\) and \\(b_1 = b_2 = \\ldots = b_n\\).\n\n3. Compare the given inequality with the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We have:\n\\[\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 \\leq n(x^4 + y^4 + z^4)\n\\]\n\n4. This shows that the given inequality is a form of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, with \\(a_1 = x^2\\), \\(a_2 = y^2\\), \\(a_3 = z^2\\), and \\(b_1 = 1\\), \\(b_2 = 1\\), \\(b_3 = 1\\).\n\n5. To find the smallest natural number \\(n\\) for which the inequality holds for all real values of \\(x, y, z\\), we need to find the smallest natural number \\(n\\) such that:\n\\[\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 \\leq n(x^4 + y^4 + z^4)\n\\]\n\n6. The smallest natural number \\(n\\) that satisfies this inequality is \\(n = 2\\). This is because when \\(n = 2\\), the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds with \\(a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 1\\) and \\(b_1 = b_2 = b_3 = 1\\), which means the inequality is automatically true for all real values of \\(x, y, z\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe smallest natural number \\(n\\) for which the inequality \\((x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 \\leq n(x^4 + y^4 + z^4)\\) holds for all real values of \\(x, y, z\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
      "1. We start with the given inequality:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 \\leq n(x^4 + y^4 + z^4)\n\\]\n\n2. To find the minimum natural number $n$ for which this inequality holds for all real values of $x$, $y$, and $z$, we first observe that the left-hand side of the inequality is always non-negative for real $x$, $y$, and $z$, and the right-hand side is always non-negative as well. Therefore, the inequality holds for all real values of $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n\n3. Now, consider when $n = 1$. In this case, the inequality simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 \\leq x^4 + y^4 + z^4\n\\]\n\nLet's analyze this inequality for different values of $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n\n4. Consider the case when $x = y = z = 1$. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n\\[\n(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2)^2 \\leq 1^4 + 1^4 + 1^4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3^2 \\leq 3\n\\]\n\nThis inequality holds true.\n\n5. Consider the case when $x = y = z = -1$. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n\\[\n((-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2)^2 \\leq 1^4 + 1^4 + 1^4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(3^2) \\leq 3\n\\]\n\nThis inequality also holds true.\n\n6. Consider the case when $x = y = z = 2$. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n\\[\n(2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2)^2 \\leq 1^4 + 1^4 + 1^4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(3^2) \\leq 3\n\\]\n\nThis inequality also holds true.\n\n7. Consider the case when $x = y = z = -2$. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n\\[\n((-2)^2 + (-2)^2 + (-2)^2)^2 \\leq 1^4 + 1^4 + 1^4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(3^2) \\leq 3\n\\]\n\nThis inequality also holds true.\n\n8. From the above analysis, we see that the inequality holds for $n = 1$ for all values of $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n\nConclusion:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

      "Let's reason through the problem step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how much water Inlet Pipe A fills in one minute. Since it fills at a rate of 6 litres a minute, we can calculate the volume of water it fills in one hour as follows:\n\nWater filled by Inlet Pipe A in one hour = 6 litres/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 360 litres/hour\n\n2. Next, let's find out how much water Inlet Pipe B fills in one minute. Since it fills at a rate of 4 litres a minute, we can calculate the volume of water it fills in one hour as follows:\n\nWater filled by Inlet Pipe B in one hour = 4 litres/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 240 litres/hour\n\n3. Now, let's find out how much water Inlet Pipe A and Inlet Pipe B together fill in one minute. Since they both fill at the same rate, we can add their rates to find this out:\n\nTotal water filled by both pipes in one minute = 6 litres/minute + 4 litres/minute = 10 litres/minute\n\n4. Since both inlet pipes are opened simultaneously, the combined rate of water filling the tank in one minute is 10 litres/minute.\n\n5. The tank is empty in 12 hours, which is equivalent to 12 * 60 minutes = 720 minutes.\n\n6. To find out how much water the tank holds, we can use the combined rate of the inlet pipes and the time taken to empty the tank. The tank is filled by the combined rate of the inlet pipes, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nWater filled by both pipes in 720 minutes = Total capacity of the tank\n\n10 litres/minute * 720 minutes = Total capacity of the tank\n\n7200 litres = Total capacity of the tank\n\n7.

      "To find the capacity of the cistern, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the rate at which the tank is being emptied by the leak. Since the tank is emptied in 12 hours, we'll first convert this to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 12 hours is equal to 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.\n\n2. Calculate the rate of the leak. The leak empties the tank in 720 minutes, and the tank can be filled by the inlet pipes in 3 hours. So, the combined rate of the inlet pipes is 6 litres a minute (Inlet Pipe A) + 4 litres a minute (Inlet Pipe B) = 10 litres a minute.\n\n3. To find the rate of the leak, we'll subtract the combined rate of the inlet pipes from the rate at which the tank is being filled by the inlet pipes. So, the rate of the leak is 10 litres a minute - 10 litres a minute = 0 litres a minute.\n\n4. Since the leak empties the tank in 720 minutes, we can set up an equation to find the capacity of the cistern. Let C be the capacity of the cistern in litres. The leak empties C litres in 720 minutes, so C/720 = 0 litres.\n\n5. Solving for C, we get C = 0.\n\n6. However, the problem states that the leak empties the tank in 720 minutes, but the leak is not emptying the tank. The leak is only emptying the tank because of the combined rate of Inlet Pipe A and Inlet Pipe B. Therefore, the leak is not emptying the tank, it's just maintaining the same rate as the inlet pipes.\n\n7. Therefore, the leak is not emptying the tank, but it's maintaining the same rate as the inlet pipes. So, the capacity of the cistern is not C = 0, but the combined rate of the inlet pipes.\n\nFinal answer: The capacity of the cistern is 10 litres a minute * 60 minutes = 600 litres.",

      "Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many cups of each type of coffee Taylor made. Since he made 12 cups of both weak and strong coffee, we can calculate the number of cups for each by dividing the total number of cups by 2:\n\nWeak coffee cups: 12 / 2 = 6 cups\nStrong coffee cups: 12 / 2 = 6 cups\n\n2. Next, we need to determine the amount of coffee used for each type of coffee. Taylor uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water for weak coffee, so for 6 cups of weak coffee, he will use:\n\n1 tablespoon/cup * 6 cups = 6 tablespoons of coffee for weak coffee\n\nSimilarly, for strong coffee, Taylor uses 36 tablespoons of coffee for 6 cups, so:\n\n36 tablespoons / 6 cups = 6 tablespoons of coffee for strong coffee\n\n3. Now, we need to find the ratio of the amount of coffee used for strong coffee to the amount used for weak coffee. Since there are 6 tablespoons of coffee used for strong coffee and 6 tablespoons for weak coffee, the ratio is:\n\n6 tablespoons (strong coffee) : 6 tablespoons (weak coffee)\n\nThis ratio simplifies to:\n\n1:1\n\nSo, the ratio of the amount of coffee used for strong coffee to the amount used for weak coffee is 1:1.",

Since the car ran on gasoline for (Trip distance - 40 miles) miles, the total distance of the trip is the sum of the miles run on the battery and the miles on gasoline, divided by the average mileage.\n\nStep 5: Solve for the total distance.\nNow we have two equations:\n1) (Battery distance) + (Gasoline distance) = Total trip distance\n2) (Battery distance) / 55 + (Gasoline distance) / 0.02 = 1\n\nStep 6: Solve for the total distance.\nWe can solve for the total distance by first solving equation 1 for the battery distance:\nBattery distance = Total trip distance - Gasoline distance\n\nSubstituting this into equation 2, we get:\n(Total trip distance - Gasoline distance) / 55 + (Gasoline distance) / 0.02 = 1\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation.\nMultiplying through by 1050 (the least common multiple of 55 and 0.02) to clear the fractions, we get:\n1050(Total trip distance - Gasoline distance) + 1050(Gasoline distance) = 1050\n\nStep 8: Solve for the total distance.\nCombining like terms, we get:\n1050(Total trip distance - Gasoline distance) = 1050\n\nStep 9: Isolate the total distance.\nDividing both sides by 1050, we find:\nTotal trip distance - Gasoline distance = 1\n\nStep 10: Solve for the total distance.\nAdding Gasoline distance to both sides, we get:\nTotal trip distance = Gasoline distance + 1\n\nStep 11: Calculate the total distance.\nSubstituting the given values, we find:\nTotal trip distance = 0.02 gallons/mile * (Total trip distance - 40 miles) + 40 miles\n\nStep 12: Solve for the total distance.\nCombining like terms, we get:\nTotal trip distance = 0.02(Total trip distance - 40) + 40\n\nStep 13: Isolate the total distance.\nSubtracting 0.02(Total trip distance - 40) from both sides, we find:\nTotal trip distance - 0.02(Total trip distance - 40) = 40\n\nStep 14: Solve for the total distance.\nMultiplying through by 100 (the least common multiple of 0.02 and 100), we get:\n100(Total trip distance - 0.02(Total trip distance - 40)) = 4000\n\nStep 15: Isolate the total distance.\nDividing both sides by 100, we find:\nTotal trip distance - 0.02(Total trip distance - 40) = 40\n\nStep 16: Solve for the total distance.\nCombining like terms, we get:\nTotal trip distance = 40 + 0.02(Total trip distance - 40)\n\nStep 17: Isolate the total distance.\nAdding 0.02(Total trip distance - 40) to both sides, we find:\nTotal trip distance = 40 + 0.02Total trip distance - 0.02(40)\n\nStep 18: Solve for the total distance.\nCombining like terms, we get:\nTotal trip distance - 0.02Total trip distance = 40 + 0.02(4"

      "1. The given equation is $\\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}2 \\cos x\\right)=\\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}2 \\sin x\\right)$. We know that $\\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}2 \\cos x\\right) = \\cos x$ and $\\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}2 \\sin x\\right) = \\sin x$ due to the co-function identities. Thus, the equation becomes:\n   $$\\cos x = \\sin x$$\n\n2. To solve this equation, we can use the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$. We rearrange this equation to isolate $\\cos^2 x$:\n   $$\\cos^2 x = 1 - \\sin^2 x$$\n   Substituting this into our equation, we get:\n   $$\\cos x = \\sin x$$\n   Rearranging the terms, we have:\n   $$\\cos^2 x - \\cos x + \\frac{1}{4} = 0$$\n\n3. Let's solve this quadratic equation in terms of $\\cos x$. We can use the quadratic formula:\n   $$\\cos x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n   where $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = \\frac{1}{4}$. Plugging in these values, we get:\n   $$\\cos x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}}}{2}$$\n   $$\\cos x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 1}}{2}$$\n   $$\\cos x = \\frac{1 \\pm 0}{2}$$\n   $$\\cos x = 1$$\n\n4. Since the domain of the cosine function is $[-1, 1]$, the value of $\\cos x = 1$ only occurs when $x = 0$.\n\n5.

      "Step 1: Understand the given equation.\nThe equation involves the sine and cosine functions with the same argument, which is the cosine of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ times x.

      "1. First, we simplify the given equation using trigonometric identities. Since $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is the reference angle for sine and cosine, and the functions are periodic with period $2\\pi$, we can simplify the expressions to $\\sin(\\theta)$ and $\\cos(\\theta)$.\n   \\[\n   \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos x\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x\\right)\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we use the fact that $\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)$ when $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ or $\\theta = \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ (since sine and cosine are co-functions of the same angle). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos x\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x\\right)\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we can use the double angle formula for cosine, $\\cos(2\\theta) = 2\\cos^2(\\theta) - 1$, to rewrite the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos x\\right) = 2\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos x\\right) - 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x\\right) = 2\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x\\right) - 1\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtracting the two equations, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos x\\right) - \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x\\right) = 2\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos x\\right) - 2\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x\\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos x\\right) - \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x\\right) = -1\n   \\]\n\n5. This equation has a solution for $x$ when $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos x\\right) - \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x\\right) = -1$ is satisfied.\n\n6. The cosine function has a period of $2\\pi$, so we consider the intervals $[0, 2\\pi)$, $[2\\pi, 4\\pi)$, and so on.\n\n7. Within the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$, we find solutions for $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos x\\right) - \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x\\right) = -1$ when $x = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, $\\frac{3\\pi}{4}$, $\\frac{7\\pi}{4}$, and $\\frac{11\\pi}{4}$.\n\n8. Similarly, in the interval $[2\\pi, 4\\pi)$, we find solutions when $x = \\frac{3\\pi}{4}$, $\\frac{7\\pi}{4}$, $\\frac{11\\pi}{4}$, and $\\frac{15\\pi}{4}$.\n\n9. Finally, in the interval $[4\\pi, 6\\pi)$ we find solutions for $x = \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$, $\\frac{13\\pi}{4}$, and $\\frac{17\\pi}{4}$.\n\n10. Adding these solutions, we get a total of $4 + 4 + 2 = 10$ solutions within the interval $[0, \\pi]$.\n\nTherefore, the equation $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\cos x\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\sin x\\right)$ has $\\boxed{10}$ solutions in the closed interval $[0, \\pi]$."

The increase in price is 1.1P - P = 0.1P.\n\nPercentage Increase in Price = (0.1P / P) * 100 = 0.1 * 100 = 10%.\n\nSo, the percentage increase in the price of gasoline is $\\boxed{10\\%}$ .",
      "Step 1: Let's denote the original price of gasoline as P and the quantity of gasoline the driver originally buys as Q.

The difference between 110% and 100% is 10%, which is the percentage increase in the price of gasoline.\n\nStep 4: To find the percentage increase, we can set up the equation: (1.1P - P) / P = 10%.\n\nStep 5: Solving for the percentage increase, we get: 0.1P / P = 10%.\n\nStep 6: Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.1 = 10%.\n\nStep 7: To find the percentage increase, we can convert 0.1 to a percentage: 0.1 * 100% = 10%.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the percentage increase in the price of gasoline is 10%.\n\nFinal Answer: The percentage increase in the price of gasoline is \\boxed{10\\%}.",

The correct price increase is not 10%, but rather a different percentage that we need to find.\n\nStep 10: Let's assume the price increase is P1.

The new total cost of gasoline for the driver is (Q - 0.12Q) * P1.\n\nStep 11: According to the problem, the driver should reduce the quantity of gasoline by 12%. This means the driver should buy (1 - 0.12)Q quantity of gasoline, which is 0.88Q quantity.\n\nStep 12: The new price of gasoline is P1, and the new quantity of gasoline is 0.88Q. The new total cost of gasoline for the driver is (0.88Q) * P1.\n\nStep 13: We know the original total cost of gasoline for the driver is P * Q dollars.

Therefore, the new selling price is:\n\nNew selling price = Initial selling price + 15% of Initial selling price\nNew selling price = $x + 0.15x\nNew selling price = $1.15x\n\nNow, we know that the new selling price is $1250 + $500, which is $1750. So we can set up the equation:\n\n$1750 = $1.15x\n\nStep 2: Solve for the initial selling price (x).\n\nTo find the initial selling price, we need to solve the equation:\n\n$1.15x = $1750\n\nTo isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by $1.15:\n\nx = $1750 / $1.15\nx = $1500\n\nStep 3: Calculate the loss percentage when the article was initially sold.\n\nNow that we know the initial selling price (SP) was $1500, we can calculate the loss percentage. The loss is the difference between the initial selling price and the cost price:\n\nLoss = Initial selling price - Cost price\nLoss = $1500 - $1250\nLoss = $250\n\nTo find the loss percentage, we use the formula:\n\nLoss percentage = (Loss / Cost price) * 100\n\nLoss percentage = ($250 / $1250) * 100\nLoss percentage = 0.2 * 100\nLoss percentage = 20%\n\nSo the loss percentage when the article was initially sold is $\\boxed{20\\%}$ .",

      "Step 1: Determine the original selling price.\nThe original selling price (SP) is given by the formula:\nSP = CP - Loss\nWhere CP is the cost price and Loss is the loss percentage of the article.\n\nGiven that the cost price (CP) is $1250 and the gain percentage is 15%, we can calculate the original selling price (SP) as follows:\nSP = CP + (Loss percentage * CP)\nSP = $1250 + (15% of $1250)\nSP = $1250 + ($1250 * 0.15)\nSP = $1250 + $187.50\nSP = $1437.50\n\nStep 2: Determine the new selling price.\nIf the selling price were increased by $500, the new selling price (SN) would be:\nSN = SP + $500\nSN = $1437.50 + $500\nSN = $1937.50\n\nStep 3: Determine the gain when the selling price is increased by $500.\nIf a gain of 15% on the original selling price of $1437.50 results in a selling price of $1937.50, then the gain is calculated as:\nGain = SN - SP\nGain = $1937.50 - $1437.50\nGain = $500\n\nStep 4: Determine the loss percentage when the selling price was initially sold.\nThe loss percentage is calculated as:\nLoss percentage = (Loss / CP) * 100\nLoss percentage = (Gain / CP) * 100\nLoss percentage = ($500 / $1250) * 100\nLoss percentage = 0.4 * 100\nLoss percentage = 40%\n\nTherefore, the loss percentage when the article was initially sold is $\\boxed{40\\%}$ .",

This means that the new selling price would be 115% of the original selling price.\n\nStep 3: Let the original selling price be S. Then, the new selling price would be S + $500.\n\nStep 4: We also know that the new selling price is 115% of the original selling price. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\nS + $500 = 1.15 * S\n\nStep 5: Solving the equation, we get:\n\n$500 = S * (1.15 - 1)\n$500 = S * 0.15\nS = $500 / 0.15\nS = $3333.33 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nStep 6: Now, we can find the original selling price by subtracting the $500 increase from the new selling price:\n\nOriginal selling price = $3333.33 - $500\nOriginal selling price = $2833.33\n\nStep 7: The cost price of the article was $1250. Therefore, the loss when the article was initially sold would be:\n\nLoss = Original selling price - Cost price\nLoss = $2833.33 - $1250\nLoss = $1583.33\n\nStep 8: To find the loss percentage, we use the formula:\n\nLoss percentage = (Loss / Cost price) * 100\n\nStep 9: Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nLoss percentage = ($1583.33 / $1250) * 100\nLoss percentage = 12.45 * 100\nLoss percentage = 1245%\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the loss percentage when the article was initially sold is 12.45%.\n\nFinal Answer: The loss percentage when the article was initially sold is $\\boxed{12.45\\%}$ ."

Since $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 13, we have $a_0 = 0$.\n\n3. Let $Q(x)$ be the quotient polynomial. Then, we can write $P(x) = (d(x))(Q(x))$.\n\n4. According to the division algorithm, we have $P(x) = (d(x))(Q(x)) + 3 x^3 + 4 x^2 - x + 12$.\n\n5. Substituting $x = 0$ into the equation, we get $a_0 = 0$, which simplifies to $0 = 3 \\cdot 0 + 4 \\cdot 0 - 0 + 12$.\n\n6. Simplifying further, we find that $12 = 12$. This is consistent with our assumption that $a_0 = 0$.\n\n7.

      "Step 1: Understand the problem and the relationship between the degrees of polynomials.\n\nWhen a polynomial of degree $13$ is divided by $d(x)$, the quotient is of degree $7$ and the remainder is $3x^3 + 4x^2 - x + 12$. This tells us that the degree of the remainder is one less than the degree of the divisor.\n\nStep 2: Determine the degree of $d(x)$.\n\nThe degree of $d(x)$ is the highest power of $x$ in the polynomial $d(x)$. Since the remainder has a degree of $3$, $d(x)$ must have a degree greater than $3$ to accommodate the remainder.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the degree of $d(x)$.\n\nSince the degree of the remainder is $3$, we can find the degree of $d(x)$ by adding $3$ to the highest power of $x$ in the polynomial $13$.

Here, we are given the remainder as 3x^3 + 4x^2 - x + 12.\n\nStep 3: Apply the Polynomial Remainder Theorem\nWe know that the remainder when a polynomial f(x) is divided by (x - a) is f(a).

Now, we take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorization of 8, 11, and 24:\n- The highest power of 2 that appears is 2^3\n- The highest power of 3 that appears is 3^1\n- The highest power of 11 that appears is 11^1\n\n3. Multiply these highest powers to get the LCM:\n- LCM = 2^3 * 3^1 * 11^1\n- LCM = 8 * 3 * 11\n- LCM = 24 * 11\n- LCM = 264\n\n4. Now, we need to find the smallest number that, when increased by some number, is divisible by 264.\n\n5. Let's denote the smallest number as \"x\". The equation to find \"x\" would be:\n- x + some number = 264\n\n6. To find the smallest \"x\", we need to find the smallest positive integer that, when added to any number, gives 264.\n\n7.

To find the percentage decrease of y compared to z, we need to find the difference between y and z and then divide by z, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:\n\nPercentage decrease of y compared to z = [(y - z) / z] * 100\n\nSubstitute the values of y and z:\n\nPercentage decrease of y compared to z = [(1.20 * 1.48 * z - z) / (1.48 * z)] * 100\n\nNow we can simplify the equation:\n\nPercentage decrease of y compared to z = [(1.20 * 1.48 - 1) / 1.48] * 100\nPercentage decrease of y compared to z = [(1.876 - 1) / 1.48] * 100\nPercentage decrease of y compared to z = [0.876 / 1.48] * 100\nPercentage decrease of y compared to z = 0.60 * 100\nPercentage decrease of y compared to z = 60%\n\nSo, y is 60% less than z."
