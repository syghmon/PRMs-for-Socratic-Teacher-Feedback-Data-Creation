      "1. Let's denote the trapezoid as $ABCD$, where $AB \\parallel CD$ and $AB = c$ and $CD = d$.\n\n2. Consider the trapezoid divided into two smaller trapezoids by the line parallel to the bases. Let the smaller trapezoid be $ABEH$ with $E$ and $H$ as the points where the smaller trapezoid touches $CD$.\n\n3. Since $EH$ is parallel to $CD$ and $AB$, it forms a parallelogram with $EH$ parallel to $CD$ and $AB$ parallel to $EH$.\n\n4. Let $AE = x$ and $EH = y$. Then, $AB = x + y$ and $CD = d - y$.\n\n5. The area of the trapezoid $ABCD$ is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{(sum of bases)} \\times \\text{(height)}\n\\]\nSince the height of the trapezoid is the same for both smaller trapezoids, it is the same as the height of the original trapezoid.\n\n6. For the smaller trapezoid $ABEH$, the area can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{ABEH} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (c + d - y) \\times y\n\\]\nSince this area is the same as the area of the original trapezoid, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times (c + d - y) \\times y = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (c + d) \\times (x + y)\n\\]\n\n7. Simplifying the above equation:\n\\[\n(c + d - y) \\times y = (c + d) \\times x + (c + d) \\times y\n\\]\n\\[\n(c + d - y) \\times y - (c + d) \\times y = (c + d) \\times x\n\\]\n\\[\ny \\times (c + d - y - c - d) = (c + d) \\times x\n\\]\n\\[\ny \\times (-2y) = (c + d) \\times x\n\\]\n\\[\n-2y^2 = (c + d) \\times x\n\\]\n\\[\ny^2 = \\frac{(c + d) \\times x}{2}\n\\]\n\n8.

      "1. Let $ABCD$ be the given right trapezoid, where $AB \\parallel CD$ and $AB = c$, $CD = d$.\n2. Draw a line $EF$ parallel to $AB$ and $CD$ that splits the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids.\n3. The line $EF$ intersects the bases $AD$ and $BC$ at points $E$ and $F$ respectively.\n4. Since $EF$ is parallel to $AB$ and $CD$, the triangles $\\triangle ADE$ and $\\triangle BFC$ are similar by the AA similarity criterion (both have a right angle and share an angle at $E$ and $F$).\n5. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the bases. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{DE}{AD} = \\frac{EF}{BC} = \\frac{d}{c}\n   \\]\n6. The given trapezoid is isosceles, meaning $AD = BC$.\n7. The line $EF$ also splits the trapezoid into two smaller isosceles trapezoids.\n8. By the symmetry of the trapezoid, the line $EF$ must be parallel to the bases $AD$ and $BC$.\n9. Since $EF$ is parallel to $AB$ and $CD$, the line $EF$ must be parallel to $AD$ and $BC$.\n10. The line $EF$ forms a rectangle with $AD$ and $BC$, as it is parallel and equal in length to both bases.\n11. The diagonal of this rectangle, which is the line $EF$, is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs $AD$ and $BC$.\n12. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the diagonal $EF$:\n   \\[\n   EF = \\sqrt{AD^2 + BC^2}\n   \\]\n13. Substituting the values of $AD$ and $BC$, we get:\n   \\[\n   EF = \\sqrt{c^2 + d^2}\n   \\]\n14. Since $EF$ is the base of the original trapezoid, the sum of the bases $AD + BC = EF$.\n15. Substituting the value of $EF$ from step 13, we have:\n   \\[\n   AD + BC = \\sqrt{c^2 + d^2}\n   \\]\n16. Given that $AD = BC$, we can simplify this equation to:\n   \\[\n   2AD = \\sqrt{c^2 + d^2}\n   \\]\n17. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:\n   \\[\n   AD = \\frac{\\sqrt{c^2 + d^2}}{2}\n   \\]\n18. Therefore, the bases of the original trapezoid are:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{c^2 + d^2}}{2}}\n   \\]",
      "1. Let's denote the trapezoid as ABCD with bases AB and CD, and the diagonals AC and BD.\n\n2. Let the line parallel to the bases of the trapezoid intersects the sides AB and CD at points E and F, respectively.\n\n3. We need to find the bases of the trapezoid, which means we need to find the lengths of the bases AB and CD.\n\n4. Let's denote the points where the circle inscribed in each of the smaller trapezoids touches the bases of the trapezoid as P and Q, respectively.\n\n5. Draw lines through points P and Q parallel to the bases of the trapezoid, which will intersect the bases at points R and S.\n\n6. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the triangles APQ and BQD are similar. This is because they share the same angle at Q and both have a right angle (as they are inscribed in the trapezoid).\n\n7. Therefore, the ratios of the corresponding sides of these triangles are equal:\n\\[\n\\frac{AP}{PQ} = \\frac{BQ}{QD}\n\\]\n\n8. Given that PQ = QR, we can write:\n\\[\n\\frac{AP}{QR} = \\frac{BQ}{QD}\n\\]\n\n9. Since AP + BQ = CD and PQ + QR = AB, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\nAP + BQ = CD = AB + QR = AB + PQ = CD\n\\]\n\n10. This implies that AP = BQ. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[\nAP = BQ = \\frac{CD}{2}\n\\]\n\n11. Since AP + BQ = CD, we can substitute the value of AP:\n\\[\n\\frac{CD}{2} + BQ = CD\n\\]\n\n12. Solving for BQ, we get:\n\\[\nBQ = \\frac{CD}{2} - \\frac{CD}{2} = \\frac{CD}{2}\n\\]\n\n13. Since PQ = QR = $\\frac{CD}{2}$, we can conclude that the bases of the original trapezoid are equal to CD.\n\n\\boxed{CD}",
      "To solve this problem, we will use the properties of trapezoids, circles, and similar triangles.

We need to find the bases of the original trapezoid.\n\n2. **Analyze the trapezoid and its smaller trapezoids**: Since the trapezoid is right, the bases of the smaller trapezoids are parallel to the bases of the original trapezoid. The smaller trapezoids are formed by inscribing circles in the larger trapezoid.\n\n3. **Use the properties of the trapezoid**: In a trapezoid, the diagonals divide it into four triangles. Each of these triangles has a base equal to the sum of the lengths of the bases of the trapezoid.\n\n4. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem**: In the triangles formed by the diagonals, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the relationship between the bases and the height of the trapezoid. Specifically, we can use the theorem in the triangles formed by the diagonals and the bases of the smaller trapezoids.\n\n5. **Set up the equations**: Let $x$ be the height of the smaller trapezoids and $y$ be the height of the original trapezoid.

      "1. Let's denote the bases of the original trapezoid as $a$ and $b$, and the legs of the trapezoid as $c$ and $d$.\n2. Since a circle is inscribed in each of the two smaller trapezoids, the radius of the inscribed circle in each trapezoid is equal to half the height of the trapezoid.\n3. The height of the trapezoid is equal to the difference between the bases, i.e., $h = b - a$.\n4. The radius of the inscribed circle in each trapezoid is equal to half the height, so $r = \\frac{h}{2} = \\frac{b - a}{2}$.\n5. According to the formula for the area of a trapezoid, the area of each smaller trapezoid is equal to $\\frac{h}{2} \\times r = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{b - a}{2} \\times \\frac{b - a}{2}$.\n6.

Further simplification gives $S = \\frac{1}{8} \\times (b - a)^2 + \\frac{1}{8} \\times (d - a)^2$.\n9. Since the area of the trapezoid is the same for both smaller trapezoids, we can set up the equation $S = \\frac{1}{8} \\times (b - a)^2 + \\frac{1}{8} \\times (b - a)^2 = S_1 = \\frac{1}{8} \\times (b - a)^2 + \\frac{1}{8} \\times (d - a)^2$.\n10. Combining like terms gives $2S = \\frac{1}{8} \\times (b - a)^2 + \\frac{1}{8} \\times (d - a)^2$.\n11.

Taking the square root of both sides gives $\\sqrt{2S} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{8} \\times (b + d - 2a)^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{(b + d)^2 - 4a(b + d)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{(b + d)^2 - 4ab - 4ad}$.\n13. Since $S = \\frac{1}{8} \\times (b - a)^2 + \\frac{1}{8} \\times (d - a)^2$, we can substitute this value into the equation to get $\\sqrt{2S} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{8} \\times (b - a)^2 + \\frac{1}{8} \\times (d - a)^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{(b - a + d - a)^2 - 4ab - 4ad} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{(b + d - 2a)^2 - 4ab - 4ad}$.\n14.

We need to find the bases of the original trapezoid $ABCD$ when a line parallel to the bases splits it into two smaller trapezoids, each with a circle inscribed in it. This line is the median of the trapezoid.\n\n3. Let's denote the median of the trapezoid $ABCD$ by $m$. The median divides the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids.\n\n4. The smaller trapezoids each have a circle inscribed in them. By the property of the circle inscribed in a trapezoid, the radii of the inscribed circles in the two smaller trapezoids are equal. Let's denote this common radius by $r$.\n\n5. The bases of the smaller trapezoids are $AD$ and $BC$, and the height of each smaller trapezoid is $m$. The radius $r$ of the inscribed circle in each smaller trapezoid can be found using the formula for the radius of an inscribed circle in a trapezoid:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{m \\cdot (AD + BC)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n6. Since the radii of the inscribed circles are equal, we have:\n   \\[\n   r = r = \\frac{m \\cdot (AD + BC)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n7. Substituting $AD = c$ and $BC = d$, we get:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{m \\cdot (c + d)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n8. Now, we need to find the bases $AD$ and $BC$ of the original trapezoid. Let's denote the bases of the original trapezoid by $x$ and $y$.\n\n9. Since the median $m$ is the average of the bases $AD$ and $BC$, we have:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{x + y}{2}\n   \\]\n\n10. From the relationship between the bases and the radius of the inscribed circle, we can write:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{x + y}{2} = \\frac{m \\cdot (x + y)}{2}\n    \\]\n\n11. Substituting $m = \\frac{x + y}{2}$ and $r = \\frac{m \\cdot (x + y)}{2}$ into the equation, we get:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{x + y}{2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{x + y}{2}\\right) \\cdot (x + y)}{2}\n    \\]\n\n12. Simplifying the equation, we find:\n    \\[\n    x + y = \\frac{x + y \\cdot (x + y)}{2}\n    \\]\n\n13. Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction, we get:\n    \\[\n    2x + 2y = x + y \\cdot (x + y)\n    \\]\n\n14. Subtracting $2x$ from both sides, we get:\n    \\[\n    2y = y \\cdot (x + y)\n    \\]\n\n15. Dividing both sides by $y$, we get:\n    \\[\n    2 = x + y\n    \\]\n\n16. Solving for $x$, we find:\n    \\[\n    x = y - 1\n    \\]\n\n17. Since $x$ and $y$ are the bases of the trapezoid, and we are given that $c < d$, we can deduce that $x = d - c$.\n\n18.

The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + b}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{ab}\n\\]\n\nThis implies that the arithmetic mean of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) is greater than or equal to their geometric mean. Therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{u + v}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{uv}\n\\]\n\n3. Substituting the expressions for \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) into the inequality, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + y + \\sqrt{y^2 + 1}}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{(x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1})(y + \\sqrt{y^2 + 1})}\n\\]\n\n4. Simplifying the right-hand side of the inequality, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1})(y + \\sqrt{y^2 + 1})} = \\sqrt{xy + x\\sqrt{y^2 + 1} + y\\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + x + y + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + \\sqrt{y^2 + 1}}\n\\]\n\n5. Combining the terms under the square root, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{xy + x\\sqrt{y^2 + 1} + y\\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + (x + y + 2)}\n\\]\n\n6. Since \\( x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} \\) and \\( y + \\sqrt{y^2 + 1} \\) are always greater than or equal to 1, the expression inside the square root is at least 1:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{xy + x\\sqrt{y^2 + 1} + y\\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + (x + y + 2)} \\geq 1\n\\]\n\n7. Therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + y + \\sqrt{y^2 + 1}}{2} \\geq 1\n\\]\n\n8. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n\\[\nx + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + y + \\sqrt{y^2 + 1} \\geq 2\n\\]\n\n9. Adding 1 to both sides, we obtain:\n\n\\[\nx + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + y + \\sqrt{y^2 + 1} + 1 \\geq 3\n\\]\n\n10. Therefore,\n\n\\[\nx + y \\geq 3 - (\\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + \\sqrt{y^2 + 1})\n\\]\n\n11. To find the minimum value of \\( x + y \\), we need to minimize \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + \\sqrt{y^2 + 1} \\). By the AM-GM inequality, the sum of the square roots is minimized when the two terms are equal, i.e.,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + 1} = \\sqrt{y^2 + 1}\n\\]\n\n12. Solving for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nx = y\n\\]\n\n13. Substituting \\( x = y \\) into the inequality, we get:\n\n\\[\nx + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} \\geq 3\n\\]\n\n14. Simplifying, we have:\n\n\\[\n2x + 2\\sqrt{x^2 + 1} \\geq 3\n\\]\n\n15. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n\\[\nx + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} \\geq \\frac{3}{2}",

First, let's expand the left side of the inequality:\n   \\[\n   \\left(x + \\sqrt{x^{2} + 1}\\right)\\left(y + \\sqrt{y^{2} + 1}\\right) = xy + x\\sqrt{y^{2} + 1} + y\\sqrt{x^{2} + 1} + \\sqrt{x^{2}y^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + 1}\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, let's rewrite the inequality to highlight the terms involving \\(\\sqrt{x^{2} + 1}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{y^{2} + 1}\\):\n   \\[\n   xy + x\\sqrt{y^{2} + 1} + y\\sqrt{x^{2} + 1} + \\sqrt{x^{2}y^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + 1} \\geqslant 1\n   \\]\n\n4. Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are real numbers, we can infer that \\(x^{2} + 1 \\geqslant 0\\) and \\(y^{2} + 1 \\geqslant 0\\). Therefore, the term \\(\\sqrt{x^{2} + 1}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{y^{2} + 1}\\) are always non-negative.\n\n5. Hence, the inequality simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   xy + x\\sqrt{y^{2} + 1} + y\\sqrt{x^{2} + 1} + \\sqrt{x^{2}y^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + 1} \\geqslant 1\n   \\]\n\n6. Notice that \\(\\sqrt{x^{2}y^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + 1} \\geqslant 1\\), because \\(x^{2}y^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + 1 \\geqslant x^{2} + y^{2} + 1\\) (since \\(x^{2} + 1 \\geqslant 0\\) and \\(y^{2} + 1 \\geqslant 0\\)).\n\n7. Therefore, the inequality becomes:\n   \\[\n   xy + x\\sqrt{y^{2} + 1} + y\\sqrt{x^{2} + 1} + 1 \\geqslant 1\n   \\]\n\n8. Subtracting 1 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   xy + x\\sqrt{y^{2} + 1} + y\\sqrt{x^{2} + 1} \\geqslant 0\n   \\]\n\n9. We can now see that:\n   \\[\n   x + y \\geqslant \\sqrt{xy}\n   \\]\n\n10. Since \\(\\sqrt{xy} \\geqslant 0\\) for any real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), the minimum value of \\(x + y\\) is:\n    \\[\n    \\boxed{\\sqrt{xy}}\n    \\]",

Expanding the product:\n   \\[\n   x y + x \\sqrt{y^{2}+1} + y \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} \\sqrt{y^{2}+1} \\geqslant 1\n   \\]\n\n3. Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   x y + y \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + x \\sqrt{y^{2}+1} + \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} \\sqrt{y^{2}+1} \\geqslant 1\n   \\]\n\n4. Notice that the term \\(\\sqrt{x^{2}+1} \\sqrt{y^{2}+1}\\) can be simplified using the identity \\(\\sqrt{a} \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} \\sqrt{y^{2}+1} = \\sqrt{(x^{2}+1)(y^{2}+1)} = \\sqrt{x^{2} y^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + 1}\n   \\]\n\n5. Substitute this back into the inequality:\n   \\[\n   x y + y \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + x \\sqrt{y^{2}+1} + \\sqrt{x^{2} y^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + 1} \\geqslant 1\n   \\]\n\n6. Now, let's isolate \\( x + y \\):\n   \\[\n   (x y + y \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + x \\sqrt{y^{2}+1} + \\sqrt{x^{2} y^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + 1}) - 1 \\geqslant 0\n   \\]\n\n7. Simplify further:\n   \\[\n   x y + y \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + x \\sqrt{y^{2}+1} + \\sqrt{x^{2} y^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + 1} - 1 \\geqslant 0\n   \\]\n\n8. Recognize that the left side can be factored as a perfect square:\n   \\[\n   (x y + y \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + x \\sqrt{y^{2}+1} + \\sqrt{x^{2} y^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + 1}) - 1 \\geqslant 0\n   \\]\n\n9. This implies:\n   \\[\n   \\left(x y + y \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + x \\sqrt{y^{2}+1} + \\sqrt{x^{2} y^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + 1} - 1\\right)^2 \\geqslant 0\n   \\]\n\n10. Since the square of any real number is non-negative, this inequality holds true for all real values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n11. Therefore, the minimum value of \\( x + y \\) is achieved when the expression inside the square equals zero:\n   \\[\n   x y + y \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + x \\sqrt{y^{2}+1} + \\sqrt{x^{2} y^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + 1} - 1 = 0\n   \\]\n\n12. Solving for \\( x + y \\):\n   \\[\n   x y + y \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + x \\sqrt{y^{2}+1} + \\sqrt{x^{2} y^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + 1} = 1\n   \\]\n\n13. Subtracting 1 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x y + y \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + x \\sqrt{y^{2}+1} + \\sqrt{x^{2} y^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + 1} - 1 = 0\n   \\]\n\n14.

Multiply both sides of the inequality by \\(\\sqrt{y^2 + 1}\\) to remove the square root:\n   \\[\n   z \\sqrt{y^2 + 1} \\geqslant \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y^2 + 1}}\n   \\]\n\n3. Squaring both sides of the inequality to eliminate the square root:\n   \\[\n   z^2 (y^2 + 1) \\geqslant \\frac{1}{y^2 + 1}\n   \\]\n\n4. Multiply both sides of the inequality by \\(y^2 + 1\\) to further simplify:\n   \\[\n   z^2 (y^2 + 1)^2 \\geqslant 1\n   \\]\n\n5. This implies that:\n   \\[\n   z^2 \\geqslant \\frac{1}{y^2 + 1}\n   \\]\n\n6. Since \\( z = x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} \\), we can rewrite \\( z \\) as:\n   \\[\n   z = x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\n   \\]\n\n7. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   (x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1})^2 \\geqslant \\frac{1}{y^2 + 1}\n   \\]\n\n8. Taking the square root of both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} \\geqslant \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y^2 + 1}}\n   \\]\n\n9. Squaring both sides again, we obtain:\n   \\[\n   (x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1})^2 \\geqslant \\frac{1}{y^2 + 1}\n   \\]\n\n10. This implies that:\n    \\[\n    x^2 + 2\\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + x \\geqslant \\frac{1}{y^2 + 1}\n    \\]\n\n11. Subtract \\( x \\) from both sides:\n    \\[\n    2\\sqrt{x^2 + 1} \\geqslant \\frac{1}{y^2 + 1} - x\n    \\]\n\n12. Since \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} \\geqslant x \\) for all \\( x \\), we have:\n    \\[\n    2x \\geqslant \\frac{1}{y^2 + 1} - x\n    \\]\n\n13. Multiplying both sides by \\( y^2 + 1 \\):\n    \\[\n    2x(y^2 + 1) \\geqslant 1 - xy\n    \\]\n\n14. Adding \\( xy \\) to both sides:\n    \\[\n    2xy + 2x(y^2 + 1) \\geqslant 1\n    \\]\n\n15. Dividing both sides by 2:\n    \\[\n    xy + x(y^2 + 1) \\geqslant \\frac{1}{2}\n    \\]\n\n16. Therefore, the minimum value of \\( x + y \\) is:\n    \\[\n    \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n    \\]",

Let's denote \\( t = \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} \\).\n\n4. Then, \\( x = t \\) and \\( y = \\sqrt{t^{2}+1} \\).\n\n5.

Simplifying the inequality, we have:\n\\[\nt\\left(\\sqrt{t^{2}+1}+\\sqrt{t^{2}+2}\\right) + \\sqrt{t^{2}+1}\\left(\\sqrt{t^{2}+1}+\\sqrt{t^{2}+2}\\right) \\geqslant 1\n\\]\n\n7. Further simplification leads to:\n\\[\nt^{2} + t\\sqrt{t^{2}+2} + t\\sqrt{t^{2}+1} + \\sqrt{t^{2}+1}\\sqrt{t^{2}+2} \\geqslant 1\n\\]\n\n8.

Then, \\( t = u^{2} \\).\n\n10. Substituting \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) into the inequality, we get:\n\\[\nu^{4} + u\\sqrt{u^{2}+2} + u\\sqrt{u^{2}+1} + \\sqrt{u^{2}+1}\\sqrt{u^{2}+2} \\geqslant 1\n\\]\n\n11. Let \\( v = \\sqrt{u^{2}+1} \\). Then, \\( u = v^{2} \\).\n\n12.

Notice that \\( v^{4} + v\\sqrt{v^{2}+2} + v\\sqrt{v^{2}+1} + \\sqrt{v^{2}+1}\\sqrt{v^{2}+2} \\geqslant 1 \\).\n\n14. This inequality holds because the terms on the left side represent a sum of squares and squares of sums of squares, which are always non-negative and sum to at least 1.\n\n15.

Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{x \\cdot y \\cdot (x^2 + 1) + (y^2 + 1)}\n\\]\n\n6. Substituting this back into the original inequality, we get:\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{x \\cdot y \\cdot (x^2 + 1) + (y^2 + 1)} \\geqslant 1\n\\]\n\n7. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we obtain:\n\\[\n4(x^2y^2 + xy + y^2 + 1) \\geqslant 1\n\\]\n\n8.

Since \\(x^2 + y^2 \\geqslant 0\\) (because \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are real numbers), we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\\[\nx^2y^2 + xy + y^2 + 1 - (x^2 + y^2) \\geqslant 0\n\\]\n\n12.

Since \\( A = a + \\sqrt{a^2 + 1} \\) and \\( B = b + \\sqrt{b^2 + 1} \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   A^2 = (a + \\sqrt{a^2 + 1})^2 = a^2 + 2a\\sqrt{a^2 + 1} + (a^2 + 1)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   B^2 = (b + \\sqrt{b^2 + 1})^2 = b^2 + 2b\\sqrt{b^2 + 1} + (b^2 + 1)\n   \\]\n\n8. Adding these two expressions, we get:\n   \\[\n   A^2 + B^2 = 2a^2 + 2a\\sqrt{a^2 + 1} + 2b^2 + 2b\\sqrt{b^2 + 1} + 2(a^2 + 1) + 2(b^2 + 1)\n   \\]\n\n9. Simplifying, we have:\n   \\[\n   A^2 + B^2 = 2(a^2 + 1) + 2(b^2 + 1) + 2(a\\sqrt{a^2 + 1} + b\\sqrt{b^2 + 1})\n   \\]\n\n10. Since \\( a + \\sqrt{a^2 + 1} \\geq 2 \\) and \\( b + \\sqrt{b^2 + 1} \\geq 2 \\), we have:\n    \\[\n    A^2 + B^2 \\geq 2(2) + 2(2) + 2(2) = 8\n    \\]\n\n11. Thus, we have:\n    \\[\n    A^2 + B^2 \\geq 8\n    \\]\n\n12. Given that \\( A + B \\geq 2\\sqrt{AB} \\geq 2\\sqrt{2} \\), the minimum value of \\( A + B \\) is:\n    \\[\n    A + B \\geq 2\\sqrt{2}\n    \\]\n\n13. Therefore, the minimum value of \\( x + y \\) is:\n    \\[\n    \\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}\n    \\]",
      "1. Let's begin by using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:\n   \\[\n   \\left(x+\\sqrt{x^{2}+1}\\right)\\left(y+\\sqrt{y^{2}+1}\\right) \\geqslant \\left(x+y\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{x^{2}+1}+\\sqrt{y^{2}+1}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n2. We know that \\( \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + \\sqrt{y^{2}+1} \\geqslant 2\\sqrt{\\sqrt{x^{2}+1}\\cdot \\sqrt{y^{2}+1}} = 2\\sqrt{x^{2}y^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+1} \\).\n\n3. Substituting this into the inequality, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\left(x+\\sqrt{x^{2}+1}\\right)\\left(y+\\sqrt{y^{2}+1}\\right) \\geqslant \\left(x+y\\right)\\left(2\\sqrt{x^{2}y^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+1}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. Dividing both sides by \\( 2\\sqrt{x^{2}y^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+1} \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(x+\\sqrt{x^{2}+1}\\right)\\left(y+\\sqrt{y^{2}+1}\\right) \\geqslant \\left(x+y\\right)\n   \\]\n\n5. This inequality is equivalent to:\n   \\[\n   x+\\sqrt{x^{2}+1} \\geqslant \\frac{x+y}{\\sqrt{x^{2}y^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+1}}\n   \\]\n\n6. Squaring both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\left(x+\\sqrt{x^{2}+1}\\right)^{2} \\geqslant \\frac{(x+y)^{2}}{x^{2}y^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+1}\n   \\]\n\n7. Simplifying the left-hand side, we have:\n   \\[\n   x^{2} + 2x\\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + x^{2}+1 \\geqslant \\frac{(x+y)^{2}}{x^{2}y^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+1}\n   \\]\n\n8. Multiplying both sides by \\( x^{2}y^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+1 \\), we obtain:\n   \\[\n   x^{2} \\left(x^{2}+1\\right) + 2x^{2} \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + x^{2} + 1 \\geqslant (x+y)^{2}\n   \\]\n\n9. Expanding and simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   x^{4} + x^{2} + 1 + 2x^{2} \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + x^{2} + 1 \\geqslant x^{2} + 2xy + y^{2}\n   \\]\n\n10. Combining like terms, we have:\n    \\[\n    x^{4} + 2x^{2} \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + 2x^{2} + 1 \\geqslant x^{2} + 2xy + y^{2}\n    \\]\n\n11. Subtracting \\( x^{2} + 2xy + y^{2} \\) from both sides, we get:\n    \\[\n    x^{4} + 2x^{2} \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + 2x^{2} + 1 - x^{2} - 2xy - y^{2} \\geqslant 0\n    \\]\n\n12. Simplifying, we have:\n    \\[\n    x^{4} + x^{2} \\sqrt{x^{2}+1} + 2x^{2} + 1 - 2xy - y^{2} \\geqslant 0\n    \\]\n\n13.

      "To find the maximum value of $3a + b$ given $9a^2 + b^2 - 6a - 2b = 0$, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the given equation to form a standard quadratic equation:**\n\n   We start by moving all terms to one side to get a standard quadratic equation:\n   \\[\n   9a^2 + b^2 - 6a - 2b = 0 \\implies 9a^2 - 6a + b^2 - 2b = 0\n   \\]\n   We can rewrite this as:\n   \\[\n   9a^2 - 6a + (b - 1)^2 - 1 = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Complete the square for the quadratic part:**\n\n   To complete the square, we need to add and subtract $(\\frac{-6}{2})^2 = 9$ inside the parentheses:\n   \\[\n   9a^2 - 6a + 9 - 9 + (b - 1)^2 - 1 = 0 \\implies (3a - 3)^2 + (b - 1)^2 - 10 = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   3a - 3 + b - 1 = \\sqrt{10} \\implies 3a + b - 4 = \\sqrt{10}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Relate $3a + b$ to the completed square:**\n\n   Rearrange the equation to isolate $3a + b$:\n   \\[\n   3a + b = 4 + \\sqrt{10}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Apply the AM-GM inequality:**\n\n   We know that the arithmetic mean (AM) is greater than or equal to the geometric mean (GM) for non-negative numbers. Applying this to $3a + b$ and $4$, we get:\n   \\[\n   3a + b \\geq 2\\sqrt{3a \\cdot b}\n   \\]\n   Substituting $4$ for $3a + b$, we have:\n   \\[\n   4 \\geq 2\\sqrt{3a \\cdot b} \\implies \\sqrt{3a \\cdot b} \\leq 2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Square both sides and solve for $3a \\cdot b$:**\n\n   Squaring both sides gives us:\n   \\[\n   3a \\cdot b \\leq 4^2 = 16\n   \\]\n   Now, we need to find the maximum value of $3a + b$. This can be achieved by letting $3a + b = 2\\sqrt{3a \\cdot b}$, which occurs when $3a + b$ is minimized. This happens when $3a$ and $b$ are equal, i.e., $3a = b$.\n\n6. **Substitute and solve for $a$ and $b$:**\n\n   Setting $3a = b$ gives us:\n   \\[\n   3a = b \\implies 3a = a + a \\implies 2a = a \\implies a = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting back into the original equation:\n   \\[\n   9\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - 6\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   9 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} - 3 - 1 = 0 \\implies \\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} - 4 = 0 \\implies \\frac{10}{4} - 4 = 0 \\implies 2.5 - 4 = 0 \\implies -1.5 = 0\n   \\]\n   This result does not satisfy the original equation, so there is a mistake in the interpretation. Let's correct it:\n\n   Correct interpretation:\n   \\[\n   3a + b = 2\\sqrt{3a \\cdot b} \\implies 3a + b = 2\\sqrt{3a \\cdot b} \\implies 3\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} = 2\\sqrt{3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} \\implies \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\",

    "problem": "A leak in the bottom of a tank can empty the full tank in 3 hours. There are two inlet pipes which can fill the tank. Inlet Pipe A fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, while Inlet Pipe B fills the tank at a rate of 4 litres a minute. Both inlet pipes are opened simultaneously when the tank is full, and due to the leak, the tank is empty in 12 hours. How many litres does the cistern hold?",

      "Step 1: Determine the rate at which the tank is being filled without the leak.\nWhen the inlet pipes are open, the tank fills at the rate of 6 litres a minute from Inlet Pipe A and 4 litres a minute from Inlet Pipe B. Therefore, the combined rate of the inlet pipes is 6 + 4 = 10 litres per minute.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the time it takes to fill the tank without the leak.\nIf the inlet pipes can fill the tank in 3 hours without the leak, then in one minute, they fill 10/3 litres of the tank.\n\nStep 3: Determine the rate at which the tank is being emptied by the leak.\nThe tank is emptied in 12 hours, which is 12 * 60 = 720 minutes. In this time, the leak empties 1/720 of the tank.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the rate at which the tank is being filled with the inlet pipes.\nWhen the inlet pipes are open, the tank fills at the combined rate of 10 litres per minute. In 720 minutes, it fills 10 * 720 = 7200 litres of the tank.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the capacity of the tank.\nTo find the capacity of the tank, we subtract the amount emptied by the leak from the amount filled by the inlet pipes. So, the capacity of the tank is 7200 - (1/720 * 7200) = 7200 - 100 = 7100 litres.\n\nSo, the cistern holds 7100 litres.",
      "Step 1: Determine the rate at which the tank is being emptied by the leak.\nThe leak empties the tank in 12 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the leak empties the tank in 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.\n\nStep 2: Determine the rate at which the tank is being filled by both inlet pipes.\nInlet Pipe A fills the tank at 6 litres per minute, and Inlet Pipe B fills the tank at 4 litres per minute. The combined rate of both inlet pipes is 6 + 4 = 10 litres per minute.\n\nStep 3: Set up the equation to find the rate at which the tank is being filled without the leak.\nLet x be the rate at which the tank is being filled without the leak. Then, the rate at which the tank is being filled with the leak is x - 7.2 (since the tank is emptied in 720 minutes).\n\nStep 4: Write the equation for the combined rate of the inlet pipes.\nSince the inlet pipes are filling the tank at a rate of 10 litres per minute, the combined rate is 10 litres per minute.\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\nx - 7.2 = 10\nx = 10 + 7.2\nx = 17.2 litres per minute\n\nStep 6: Calculate the total litres that the tank can hold.\nThe tank is filled at a rate of 17.2 litres per minute, and it takes 720 minutes to fill the tank without the leak.\n\nTotal litres = 17.2 litres/minute * 720 minutes\nTotal litres = 12408 litres\n\nSo, the cistern holds \\boxed{12408} litres.",
      "Step 1: Let's denote the volume of the tank as V litres.\n\nStep 2: We know that Inlet Pipe A fills the tank at a rate of 6 litres per minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the rate for Inlet Pipe A is 6 litres/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 360 litres/hour.\n\nStep 3: We also know that Inlet Pipe B fills the tank at a rate of 4 litres per minute. The rate for Inlet Pipe B is 4 litres/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 240 litres/hour.\n\nStep 4: Since both inlet pipes are opened simultaneously, the combined rate for both pipes is 360 litres/hour + 240 litres/hour = 600 litres/hour.\n\nStep 5: The tank is empty in 12 hours due to the leak. So, the rate of leak is 600 litres/hour * 12 hours = 7200 litres/hour.\n\nStep 6: The combined rate of both inlet pipes and the leak is equal to the rate of the full tank. Therefore, the combined rate is 7200 litres/hour.\n\nStep 7: To find the volume V of the tank, we can set up the following equation:\n\n7200 litres/hour = V - 7200 litres/hour (rate of leak)\n\nStep 8: Solving for V, we get:\n\nV = 7200 litres/hour + 7200 litres/hour\nV = 14400 litres/hour\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the cistern holds 14400 litres.\n\nFinal Answer: The cistern holds \\boxed{14400} litres.",
      "Step 1: Determine the rate at which the tank can be filled without the leak.\n\nThe tank can be emptied by the leak in 3 hours, so the rate at which the tank can be filled is the inverse of the leak rate. The leak empties the tank in 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. So, the leak empties the tank at a rate of 180 minutes.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the combined rate of both inlet pipes.\n\nThe inlet pipes fill the tank at a rate of 6 litres a minute and 4 litres a minute. To find their combined rate, we add these rates: 6 + 4 = 10 litres per minute.\n\nStep 3: Determine the combined rate of the inlet pipes and the leak.\n\nThe combined rate of the inlet pipes and the leak is the rate at which the tank can be filled without the leak minus the leak rate. So, the combined rate is 10 - 180/60 = 10 - 3 = 7 litres per minute.\n\nStep 4: Determine the time it takes for the tank to be filled.\n\nWhen both inlet pipes are opened, the tank is filled at a rate of 7 litres per minute. The tank takes 12 hours to be filled, so we can set up a proportion to find the total capacity of the tank:\n\n7 litres/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 12 hours = tank capacity\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total capacity of the tank.\n\nNow, we solve for the tank capacity:\n\n7 litres/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 12 hours = 5040 litres\n\nSo, the cistern holds 5040 litres.",

The tank is empty in 12 hours, which means the leak empties the tank in 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.\n\nThe leak empties the tank at a rate of 120 litres per hour (since 720 minutes * 1/720 hours/minute = 120 litres/hour).\n\nStep 2: Determine the rate at which the tank is being filled by the inlet pipes.\n\nInlet Pipe A fills water at a rate of 6 litres per minute, while Inlet Pipe B fills the tank at a rate of 4 litres per minute.

      "Step 1: Since the function $f(x) = \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}}x$ has an inverse function denoted by $g(x)$, it means that $f(x)$ is a one-to-one function.\n\nStep 2: In order for $f(x)$ to be one-to-one, its range must be $(0, +\\infty)$. This is because the logarithmic function $\\log_{\\frac{1}{2}}x$ is only defined for positive values of $x$.\n\nStep 3: The function $f(x) = \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}}x$ is monotonic, meaning that it is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

      "Step 1: Let's assume the original price of the car is P.\n\nStep 2: The trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price. This means that the profit is 60.00000000000001% of P.\n\nProfit = 60.00000000000001% * P\n\nStep 3: The trader sold the car at a 100% increase on the price he bought it. So, the selling price (SP) is equal to the original price (P) plus the profit (Profit).\n\nSP = P + Profit\n\nStep 4: We know that the profit is 60.00000000000001% of P. Substitute this into the selling price equation.\n\nSP = P + 0.6000000000000001 * P\n\nStep 5: Simplify the selling price equation.\n\n1.6000000000000001P = P + 0.6000000000000001P\n1.6000000000000001P = 1.6000000000000001P\n\nStep 6: Now, we can see that the selling price (SP) is equal to the original price (P).\n\nStep 7: Since the selling price is equal to the original price, the trader made no profit on the original price.

However, we don't have that information. But we can say that the selling price is equal to the original price, so there is no discount.\n\nFinal Answer: There was no discount percentage on the original price when the trader bought the car.",
      "Step 1: Let's denote the original price of the car as P.\n\nStep 2: The trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price. This profit can be represented as 60.00000000000001% of P.\n\nStep 3: The profit he made is the increase in price over the original price, which is 100% increase. So, the profit is equal to the original price plus 100% of the original price.\n\nStep 4: The profit in terms of P is P + (100% of P). To calculate this, we need to convert the percentage to a fraction and multiply it by the original price.\n\n100% of P = (100/100) * P = P\n\nSo, the profit is P + P = 2P.\n\nStep 5: The profit he made is equal to the profit he could have made if he had sold the car at the original price. Therefore, we can set the profit from the increase in price (2P) equal to the profit from the original price (P).\n\n2P = P\n\nStep 6: Solve for P:\n\n2P - P = P - P\nP = 0\n\nStep 7: This is an impossible scenario, as it would mean that the trader bought the car for $0, which is not possible. Therefore, there must have been a mistake in the calculation.\n\nStep 8: Let's correct the mistake. The correct way to calculate the profit is to consider the 60.00000000000001% profit on the original price. The profit is 60.00000000000001% of P.\n\nStep 9: The profit is equal to the increase in price over the original price. To find this increase, we need to convert the percentage to a fraction and multiply it by the original price.\n\n60.00000000000001% of P = (60.00000000000001/100) * P = 0.6P\n\nStep 10: The increase in price is 0.6P, which is the profit.\n\nStep 11: The profit is equal to the increase in price over the original price. Therefore, we can set the increase in price (0.6P) equal to the original price plus the increase in price.\n\n0.6P = P + 0.6P\n\nStep 12: Solve for P:\n\n0.6P - 0.6P = P - 0.6P\n0 = P - 0.6P\n0 = 0.4P\n\nStep 13: To find the discount percentage, we need to find the discount amount and divide it by the original price.\n\nDiscount amount = 0.4P = 0.4 * P = 0.4 * (100% of P) = 0.4 * 100% of P = 40% of P\n\nStep 14: The discount percentage is the discount amount over the original price.\n\nDiscount percentage = (Discount amount / Original price) * 100%\n\nStep 15: Substitute the values:\n\nDiscount percentage = (40% of P / P) * 100%\n\nStep 16: Simplify:\n\nDiscount percentage = (0.4 * 100%) * 100% = 40% * 100% = 4000%\n\nStep 17: This is not possible, as a discount cannot exceed 100%.

This profit is equivalent to 60.00000000000001% of the original price.\n3. To find the profit amount, we multiply the original price by 60.00000000000001%.\n4. The profit amount is 60.00000000000001% of the original price.\n5. Since the profit amount is also the increase in the price the trader bought the car for, we can set up an equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Original Price} \\times (1 + \\text{Discount Percentage}) = \\text{Profit Amount}\n   \\]\n6. We know that the profit amount is 60.00000000000001% of the original price. So, we can substitute this into the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Original Price} \\times (1 + \\text{Discount Percentage}) = 60.00000000000001\\% \\times \\text{Original Price}\n   \\]\n7. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   1 + \\text{Discount Percentage} = 0.6\n   \\]\n8. Subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount Percentage} = 0.6 - 1 = -0.4\n   \\]\n9. However, discount percentages cannot be negative. This means there must be a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the steps:\n\n10. The correct approach is:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Original Price} \\times (1 - \\text{Discount Percentage}) = \\text{Profit Amount}\n    \\]\n11. We know that the profit amount is 60.00000000000001% of the original price. So, we can substitute this into the equation:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Original Price} \\times (1 - \\text{Discount Percentage}) = 60.00000000000001\\% \\times \\text{Original Price}\n    \\]\n12. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n    \\[\n    1 - \\text{Discount Percentage} = 0.6\n    \\]\n13. Subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation, we get:\n    \\[\n    -\\text{Discount Percentage} = -0.4\n    \\]\n14. Taking the absolute value of both sides of the equation, we get:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Discount Percentage} = 0.4\n    \\]\n\nFinal Answer: The discount percentage on the original price when he bought the car was \\boxed{4\\%}.",
      "Step 1: Let's denote the original price as P.\n\nStep 2: The trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price, which means he sold the car for a price that is 60.00000000000001% higher than the original price.\n\nStep 3: The trader's profit can be calculated as the difference between the selling price and the original price:\nProfit = Selling Price - Original Price\n\nStep 4: We know that the trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price. Therefore, we can write:\nProfit = 60.00000000000001% of P\n\nStep 5: Since the profit is the difference between the selling price and the original price, we can also write:\nProfit = Selling Price - Original Price\n\nStep 6: From Step 4, we know that the profit is 60.00000000000001% of the original price. So, we can also write:\n60.00000000000001% of P = Selling Price - Original Price\n\nStep 7: Now, let's use the fact that the trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price. Therefore, we can write:\n60.00000000000001% of P = Selling Price - Original Price\n\nStep 8: To find the selling price, we add the original price to the profit:\nSelling Price = Original Price + Profit\nSelling Price = Original Price + (60.00000000000001% of P)\n\nStep 9: Since the trader sold the car at a 100% increase on the price he bought it, we can write:\nSelling Price = Original Price + (100% of Original Price)\nSelling Price = Original Price + Original Price\nSelling Price = 2 * Original Price\n\nStep 10: Now, let's equate the selling price we found in Step 9 with the selling price we derived from the profit:\n2 * Original Price = Original Price + Profit\n\nStep 11: Subtract Original Price from both sides of the equation:\nOriginal Price = Profit\n\nStep 12: Since the trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price, we can write:\nProfit = 60.00000000000001% of P\n\nStep 13: From Step 12, we know that the profit is 60.00000000000001% of the original price.

So, we can also write:\n60.00000000000001% of P = Selling Price - Original Price\n\nStep 16: Now, let's use the fact that the trader sold the car at a 100% increase on the price he bought it. Therefore, we can write:\nSelling Price = 2 * Original Price\n\nStep 17: From Step 16, we know that the selling price is 2 times the original price. So, we can also write:\n2 * Original Price = Selling Price\n\nStep 18: From Step 15, we know that the profit is 60.00000000000001% of the original price. So, we can also write:\n60.00000000000001% of P = Selling Price - Original Price\n\nStep 19: Now, let's equate the selling price we found in Step ",
      "Let's assume the original price of the car is P.\n\nThe trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price, so the selling price (S) is:\n\nS = P + (60.00000000000001% of P)\nS = P + 0.6000000000000001P\nS = 1.6000000000000001P\n\nThe trader sold the car at a 100% increase on the price he bought it, so the selling price (S) is also equal to the original price (P) plus the increase:\n\nS = P + (100% of P)\nS = P + P\nS = 2P\n\nNow we can set the selling price (S) equal to the profit on the original price (60.00000000000001% of P):\n\n2P = 1.6000000000000001P\n\nNow we can solve for the discount percentage (D):\n\nD = (P - P) / P * 100\nD = 0 / P * 100\nD = 0\n\nHowever, this doesn't make sense because the trader would have made a profit if he bought the car at a discount.

      "Step 1: Let's denote the original price of the car as P.\n\nStep 2: The trader bought the car at a discount, so the price he paid is P - D, where D is the discount percentage.\n\nStep 3: He sold the car at a 100% increase on the price he bought it, so the selling price is P - D + P = 2P - D.\n\nStep 4: The trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price, so the profit is 0.6000000000000001P.\n\nStep 5: We know that the profit is equal to the selling price minus the original price, so 0.6000000000000001P = 2P - D.\n\nStep 6: To find D, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding D to both sides: 0.6000000000000001P + D = 2P.\n\nStep 7: Now, we can solve for D by subtracting 0.6000000000000001P from both sides: D = 2P - 0.6000000000000001P.\n\nStep 8: Simplifying the equation gives us D = 1.4000000000000001P.\n\nStep 9: Now, we need to find the discount percentage D, which is the difference between the original price P and the price he bought it for D.\n\nStep 10: The discount percentage is calculated as (D / P) * 100%.\n\nStep 11: Substituting D = 1.4000000000000001P and P = D / 1.4000000000000001, we get: (1.4000000000000001P / P) * 100% = 1.4000000000000001 * 100%.\n\nStep 12: This simplifies to a discount percentage of 140.00000000000001%.\n\nFinal Answer: The discount percentage on the original price when he bought the car is 140.00000000000001%.",

Therefore, the selling price (SP) is P + P = 2P.\n\nStep 5: The trader made a profit of 60.00000000000001% on the original price. This profit is equal to the selling price (SP) minus the original price (P).\n\nStep 6: Let's denote the discount percentage as D.

Now, we can express the ratio $\\frac{a_1 + a_3 + a_9}{a_2 + a_4 + a_{10}}$ in terms of the arithmetic sequence:\n$$\\frac{a_1 + a_3 + a_9}{a_2 + a_4 + a_{10}} = \\frac{a_1 + (a_1 + 2d) + a_1 + (a_1 + 2d)}{a_1 + (a_1 + d) + a_1 + (a_1 + 9d)}$$\n7. Simplifying the numerator and denominator, we get:\n$$\\frac{3a_1 + 4d}{2a_1 + 10d}$$\n8. Using the expression for $a_9$ from step 5, we can substitute it into the numerator:\n$$\\frac{3a_1 + 4d}{2a_1 + 10d} = \\frac{3a_1 + 4(a_1 + 4d)}{2a_1 + 10d}$$\n9. Further simplification yields:\n$$\\frac{3a_1 + 4a_1 + 16d}{2a_1 + 10d} = \\frac{7a_1 + 16d}{2a_1 + 10d}$$\n10. Factoring out the common terms in the numerator and denominator, we get:\n$$\\frac{7a_1 + 16d}{2a_1 + 10d} = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{a_1 + 2d}{a_1 + d}$$\n11. Since $a_3 = a_1 + 2d$ and $a_9 = a_1 + 8d$, we can substitute these expressions into the equation:\n$$\\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{a_1 + 2d}{a_1 + d} = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{a_1 + 2d}{a_1 + d}$$\n12. This simplifies to:\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}$$",
      "1. Since $a_1$, $a_3$, and $a_9$ form a geometric sequence, we can write the following equation:\n$$(a_3)^2 = a_1 \\cdot a_9$$\n2. Given that $a_1$, $a_3$, and $a_9$ are terms of an arithmetic sequence, we can express $a_3$ as $a_1 + 2d$ and $a_9$ as $a_1 + 8d$. Substituting these into the equation from step 1, we get:\n$$(a_1 + 2d)^2 = a_1 \\cdot (a_1 + 8d)$$\n3. Expanding and simplifying the equation, we have:\n$$a_1^2 + 4a_1d + 4d^2 = a_1^2 + 8a_1d$$\n4. Canceling out the common terms, we get:\n$$4a_1d + 4d^2 = 8a_1d$$\n5. Simplifying further, we have:\n$$4d^2 = 4a_1d$$\n6. Dividing both sides by $4d$, we find:\n$$d = a_1$$\n7. Now, we can calculate the desired ratio:\n$$\\frac{a_1 + a_3 + a_9}{a_2 + a_4 + a_{10}} = \\frac{a_1 + a_1 + 2d + a_1 + a_1 + 8d}{a_1 + a_1 + d + a_1 + a_1 + 8d}$$\n8. Substituting the value of $d$ from step 6, we get:\n$$\\frac{3a_1 + 9d}{3a_1 + 9d} = 1$$\n9. Therefore, the final answer is:\n$$\\boxed{1}$$",

Therefore, $|z_{1}+z_{2}|=\\sqrt{z_{1}^{2}+z_{2}^{2}}$.\n3. Given that $|z_{1}+z_{2}|=\\sqrt{3}$, we can write:\n   $$\\sqrt{z_{1}^{2}+z_{2}^{2}} = \\sqrt{3}$$\n4. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, we get:\n   $$z_{1}^{2}+z_{2}^{2} = 3$$\n5.

Since $|z_{1}+z_{2}|=\\sqrt{3}$, we can deduce that $\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ because $|z_{1}+z_{2}|=\\sqrt{3}$ implies that the angle between $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ is $60^\\circ$.\n7. This means that $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ are in the first and second quadrants respectively, and their arguments are $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ respectively.\n8. The magnitude of the difference of two complex numbers is equal to the difference of their magnitudes. Therefore, $|z_{1}-z_{2}|=\\sqrt{z_{1}^{2}-z_{2}^{2}}$.\n9. Using the identity $z_{1}^{2}-z_{2}^{2} = (z_{1}+z_{2})(z_{1}-z_{2})$, we can write:\n   $$|z_{1}-z_{2}| = \\sqrt{(z_{1}+z_{2})(z_{1}-z_{2})}$$\n10.

First, let's square both sides of the given equation $|z_{1}+z_{2}|=\\sqrt{3}$ to get rid of the square root:\n\\[|z_{1}+z_{2}|^2 = 3.\\]\n\n4. We can expand this equation using the properties of complex numbers:\n\\[(z_{1} + z_{2})(z_{1} - z_{2}) = 3.\\]\n\n5. Now, let's expand the left side of the equation:\n\\[z_{1}^2 - z_{1}z_{2} + z_{2}^2 = 3.\\]\n\n6. We know that $|z_{1}|=|z_{2}|=1$, so $z_{1}^2 = z_{2}^2 = 1$.

      "Step 1: Given that $|z_{1}|=|z_{2}|=1$, we can express $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ as $z_{1}=1$ and $z_{2}=1$.\n\nStep 2: Now we need to find the value of $|z_{1}+z_{2}|$. Since $z_{1}+z_{2}=2$ (as $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ are both on the unit circle and their sum is 2), we can find the magnitude of $|z_{1}+z_{2}|$ by squaring the magnitude of $2$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate $|z_{1}+z_{2}|^2$.

To find the original loss, we subtract the cost price from the original selling price:\n\nOriginal loss = Original selling price - Cost price\nOriginal loss = $1071.43 - $1250\nOriginal loss = -$178.57\n\nStep 4: Determine the loss percentage.\n\nThe original loss is $178.57, and the cost price is $1250. To find the loss percentage, we use the formula:\n\nLoss percentage = (Original loss / Cost price) * 100\nLoss percentage = ($178.57 / $1250) * 100\nLoss percentage = 0.1433 * 100\nLoss percentage = 14.33%\n\nSo, the loss percentage when the article was initially sold was 14.33%.",
      "Step 1: Find the original selling price of the article.\n\nWe know that a 15% gain would be achieved if the selling price increased by $500. So, we first need to calculate the original selling price before the increase.\n\nThe formula for calculating the gain or loss is:\n\nGain or Loss = (Original Price - New Price)\n\nWe are given that the gain is 15%, so the formula for the gain can be rewritten as:\n\nGain = (Original Price - New Price) = 15% of Original Price\n\nLet's denote the original selling price as \"S.\"\n\nS = S - (15/100 * S)\n\nS = S * (1 - 0.15)\n\nS = S * 0.85\n\nNow we have S in terms of the original price.\n\nStep 2: Determine the cost price of the article.\n\nWe know the cost price is $1250.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the loss when the article was initially sold.\n\nThe loss can be calculated as:\n\nLoss = Original Price - New Price\n\nSince the gain is 15%, the original price before the gain was 100%. So, the loss would be:\n\nLoss = 100% - 15% = 85% of the original price\n\nNow we can find the original price using the loss:\n\nS = (100/115) * Original Price\n\nS = (100/115) * 1250\n\nS = 100 * 10\n\nS = $1000\n\nStep 4: Calculate the loss percentage.\n\nNow that we have the original selling price ($1000), we can calculate the loss percentage.\n\nLoss Percentage = (Loss / Original Price) * 100\n\nLoss Percentage = (1000 - 1250) / 1000 * 100\n\nLoss Percentage = -250 / 1000 * 100\n\nLoss Percentage = -25%\n\nThe loss percentage when the article was initially sold is -25%. This means the tradesman sold the article at a loss of 25%.",
      "Step 1: Let's denote the loss percentage as L%.\n\nStep 2: We know that if the selling price had been increased by $500, there would have been a gain of 15%.

Therefore:\n\nNew Selling Price = S + $500\n\nStep 4: According to the problem, the new selling price would have a gain of 15%. Therefore, the new selling price can also be expressed as:\n\nNew Selling Price = Original Selling Price + (15/100) * Original Selling Price\n\nStep 5: We know that the new selling price is equal to the original selling price plus $500, so we can substitute the expression for the new selling price in Step 4:\n\nS + $500 = S + (15/100) * S\n\nStep 6: Simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\nS + $500 = S + (15/100) * S\n$500 = (100/100) * S - (15/100) * S\n$500 = (1 - 15/100) * S\n$500 = (85/100) * S\n\nStep 7: Multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 85/100 to solve for S:\n\nS = $500 * (100/85)\nS = $500 * (100/85)\nS = $600\n\nStep 8: The cost price of the article is $1250. To find the loss, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:\n\nLoss = Selling Price - Cost Price\nLoss = $600 - $1250\nLoss = -$650\n\nStep 9: Since the loss is negative, it means that there was a loss of $650.\n\nStep 10: To find the loss percentage, we use the formula:\n\nLoss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) * 100\n\nStep 11: Substitute the values into the formula:\n\nLoss Percentage = ($650 / $1250) * 100\nLoss Percentage = (0.52) * 100\nLoss Percentage = 52%\n\nStep 12: Therefore, the loss percentage when the article was initially sold is 52%.\n\nFinal Answer: The loss percentage when the article was initially sold was $\\boxed{52\\%}$ .",

So, x = 0.48z.\n\nStep 4: Now, we can set up the equation from steps 2 and 3: y + 20% of y = 0.48z.\n\nStep 5: Convert the percentage to a fraction: 20% = 0.20.\n\nStep 6: So, the equation becomes: y + 0.20y = 0.48z.\n\nStep 7: Combine like terms: 1.20y = 0.48z.\n\nStep 8: Now, divide both sides by 1.20 to find y in terms of z: y = (0.48z) / 1.20.\n\nStep 9: Simplify the equation: y = 0.4z.\n\nStep 10: Now, we know y is 40 percent of z. So, y = 40% of z.\n\nStep 11: To find the percentage decrease of y compared to z, we subtract the percentage of y to z from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%.\n\nStep 12: So, y is 60% less than z.\n\nFinal Answer: y is 60% less than z.",

      "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. We know that x is 20 percent more than y. This can be written as x = y + 0.20y.\n2. Simplifying the equation, we get x = 1.20y.\n3. We are also given that x is 48 percent of z. This can be written as x = 0.48z.\n4. Now, we can set up the equation from step 2 and step 3. Since x = 1.20y, and x = 0.48z, we can substitute the value of x from step 3 into the equation from step 2: 1.20y = 0.48z.\n5. Now, we need to find the percentage decrease of y compared to z. To do this, we divide the difference between z and y by z, then multiply by 100: ((z - y) / z) * 100.\n6. Substituting the values from step 4, we get ((0.48z - 1.20y) / 0.48z) * 100.\n7. Since y is 1.20 times z, we can replace y with 1.20z in the equation: ((0.48z - 1.20 * 1.20z) / 0.48z) * 100.\n8. Simplifying the equation, we get ((0.48z - 1.44z) / 0.48z) * 100.\n9. This simplifies to ((-1.06z) / 0.48z) * 100.\n10. Further simplifying, we get (-1.06 / 0.48) * 100.\n11. Finally, we get -2.125 * 100 = -212.5.\n\nThe percentage decrease of y compared to z is therefore -212.5%.",
      "Let's denote the percentage decrease of y compared to z as p%.\n\nStep 1: Express x as a percentage of z.\nSince x is 48% of z, we can write this as:\nx = 48% of z\n\nStep 2: Express y as a percentage of z.\nSince y is some percentage less than z, let's denote this percentage as p%. Therefore, we can write this as:\ny = (100 - p%) of z\n\nStep 3: Express x in terms of y and z.\nFrom Step 1 and Step 2, we have:\nx = 48% of z\ny = (100 - p%) of z\n\nStep 4: Set the two expressions for x equal to each other.\nSince x is 48% of z and y is (100 - p%) of z, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n48% of z = (100 - p%) of z\n\nStep 5: Solve for p%.\nTo find p%, we need to solve for p% in the equation:\n0.48 * z = (100 - p%) * z\n\nDivide both sides by z:\n0.48 = (100 - p%)\n\nStep 6: Calculate p%.\nTo find p%, we subtract 48 from 100:\np% = 100 - 48\np% = 52\n\nStep 7: Calculate the percentage decrease of y compared to z.\nThe percentage decrease of y compared to z is the difference between the original value of y and the new value of y, divided by the original value of y, then multiplied by 100:\nPercentage decrease = [(100 - p%) / 100] * 100\nPercentage decrease = [(100 - 52) / 100] * 100\nPercentage decrease = [48 / 100] * 100\nPercentage decrease = 48%\n\nThe percentage decrease of y compared to z is $\\boxed{48\\%}$ .",
      "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We know that x is 20 percent more than y. This can be expressed as:\n   x = y + 0.20y\n   x = 1.20y\n\n2. We also know that x is 48 percent of z. This can be expressed as:\n   x = 0.48z\n\n3. From step 1, we can substitute x in the second equation:\n   y + 0.20y = 0.48z\n   Combine like terms:\n   1.20y = 0.48z\n\n4. To find the percentage decrease of y compared to z, we need to find the difference between z and y and then divide by z, and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n   Difference = z - y\n   Percentage decrease = (Difference / z) * 100\n\n5. From step 3, we have z = 1.20y. Plugging this into the equation for the difference:\n   Difference = 1.20y - y\n   Difference = 0.20y\n\n6. Now, let's find the percentage decrease:\n   Percentage decrease = (0.20y / 1.20y) * 100\n   Percentage decrease = (0.20 / 1.20) * 100\n   Percentage decrease = 0.166667 * 100\n   Percentage decrease = 16.6667%\n\nSo, the percentage decrease of y compared to z is approximately 16.67%."

      "Step 1: Determine the time it takes Matt to do a problem without a calculator.\n\nSince Matt saves 60 minutes by using a calculator, and he spends 2 minutes per problem with a calculator, we can calculate the time without a calculator as follows:\n\nTime per problem without a calculator = Total time saved / Time spent per problem with a calculator\n\nTime per problem without a calculator = 60 minutes / 2 minutes per problem\n\nTime per problem without a calculator = 30 minutes\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total time Matt spends doing all the problems without a calculator.\n\nSince there are 20 problems and it takes him 30 minutes to do each problem without a calculator, we can calculate the total time as follows:\n\nTotal time spent without a calculator = Time per problem without a calculator * Number of problems\n\nTotal time spent without a calculator = 30 minutes * 20 problems\n\nTotal time spent without a calculator = 600 minutes\n\nStep 3: Determine the time it takes Matt to do a problem with a calculator.\n\nWe know that Matt spends 2 minutes per problem with a calculator and the total time he spends without a calculator is 600 minutes. So, the time he spends with a calculator is:\n\nTime spent with a calculator = Total time without a calculator - Time spent without a calculator\n\nTime spent with a calculator = 600 minutes - 60 minutes\n\nTime spent with a calculator = 540 minutes\n\nStep 4: Calculate the time it takes Matt to do a problem with a calculator.\n\nSince Matt spends 540 minutes with a calculator, we can calculate the time it takes him to do a problem with a calculator as follows:\n\nTime per problem with a calculator = Total time spent with a calculator / Number of problems\n\nTime per problem with a calculator = 540 minutes / 20 problems\n\nTime per problem with a calculator = 27 minutes\n\nSo, it takes Matt 27 minutes to do a problem with a calculator.",
      "1. First, let's find out how long it would take Matt to do the assignment without using a calculator. Since it takes him 60 minutes to do the assignment with a calculator, we can find out how long it would take him to do the assignment without a calculator by dividing the time it takes to do the assignment with a calculator by the ratio of the times it takes with and without a calculator.\n\nTime without a calculator = Time with a calculator / (Ratio of times)\n\nTime without a calculator = 60 minutes / (1 / 2)\n\nTime without a calculator = 60 minutes * 2\n\nTime without a calculator = 120 minutes\n\n2. Now that we know it would take Matt 120 minutes to do the assignment without a calculator, we can use the information that using a calculator saves him 60 minutes to find out how long it takes him to do a problem without a calculator.\n\nTime without a calculator = Time with a calculator - 60 minutes\n\nTime without a calculator = 120 minutes - 60 minutes\n\nTime without a calculator = 60 minutes\n\n3. So, it takes Matt 60 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.\n\nFinal answer: Matt takes 60 minutes to do a problem without a calculator."
