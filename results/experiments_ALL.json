Since y is 48% less than z, we can find the percentage decrease of y by subtracting the percentage decrease of z from 100%. The percentage decrease of y is (48% - 100%) / 100 * 100%, which is (48 - 100) / 100 * 100% = -32%.\n\nNow, let's find the percentage decrease of z.

When the tank is empty, the rate of filling is 4 litres per minute.\n3. When the tank is empty, the rate of emptying is 10 litres per minute.\n4. In 12 hours, the tank is empty, so the time is 12 hours * 1000 minutes/hour = 12000 minutes.\n5. The cistern holds 1500 litres, so the rate of filling is 1500 litres / 12000 minutes = 1/4 litres per minute.\n6. The rate of emptying is 10 litres per minute.\n7. The cistern is emptied in 12000 minutes, so the time is 12000 minutes / 10 litres/minute = 1200 hours.\n8. The cistern holds 1500 litres, so the rate of filling is 1500 litres / 1200 hours = 1.25 litres per minute.\n9. The rate of emptying is 10 litres per minute.\n10. The cistern is emptied in 1200 hours, so the time is 1200 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 7200 minutes.\n11. The cistern holds 1500 litres, so the rate of filling is 1500 litres / 7200 minutes = 2/3 litres per minute.\n12. The rate of emptying is 10 litres per minute.\n13. The cistern is emptied in 7200 minutes, so the time is 7200 minutes / 10 litres/minute = 720 hours.\n14. The cistern holds 1500 litres, so the rate of filling is 1500 litres / 720 hours = 2.17676667 litres per minute.\n15. The rate of emptying is 10 litres per minute.\n16. The cistern is emptied in 720 hours, so the time is 720 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 43200 minutes.\n17. The cistern holds 1500 litres, so the rate of filling is 1500 litres / 43200 minutes = 0.03561766667 litres per minute.\n18. The rate of emptying is 10 litres per minute.\n19. The cistern is emptied in 43200 minutes, so the time is 43200 minutes / 10 litres/minute = 4320 hours.\n20. The cistern holds 1500 litres, so the rate of filling is 1500 litres / 4320 hours = 0.35617666667 litres per minute.\n\nThe final answer is: 1500 litres.",

The base area is the area of the square base, which is 10x10 = 100. The height of the box is the distance between the two parallel sides of the rectangle, which is 10.

Multiply the result by the number of terms:\n\n$S \\cdot n = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9$\n\nStep 8: Calculate the sum\nMultiply the result by the number of terms:\n\n$S \\cdot n = 9$\n\nStep 9: Divide the result by the common ratio\nTo find the value of the common ratio, divide the result by the common ratio:\n\n$\\frac{9}{3d} = \\frac{3}{d}$\n\nStep 10: Solve for d\nMultiply both sides by $d$ to isolate the common ratio:\n\n$3d = 9$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $3$ to solve for $d$:\n\n$d = \\frac{9}{3} = 3$\n\nStep 11: Solve for the common difference\nNow that we have the common ratio, we can find the common difference:\n\n$d = 3$\n\nAnswer: $\\frac{3}{d} = 3$\n\nAnswer: The value of $\\frac{a_1 + a_3 + a_9}{a_2 + a_4 + a_{10}}$ is $\\frac{3}{3} = 1$.",

The driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline, which means the price of gasoline is increased by 10% of the original price.\n\nStep 2: Determine the original price of gasoline\nThe original price of gasoline is unknown, but we can use the given information to determine it. Since the driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline, we can assume that the new price of gasoline will be the same as the original price plus the increase. Let's assume the original price of gasoline is x. Then, the new price of gasoline is x + (10% of x) = x + 0.1x = x + 0.1x = 1.1x.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the new price of gasoline\nTo find the new price of gasoline, we can subtract the original price from the new price: x + 0.1x = x + 0.1x = 1.1x. Now, let's subtract the original price from the new price: 1.1x - x = 0.1x. This simplifies to 0.1x = 0.1x.\n\nStep 4: Solve for the original price of gasoline\nTo solve for the original price of gasoline, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.1: 0.1x / 0.1 = x.

We already found the original price of gasoline to be 10. So, the percentage increase is (10 - 10) / 10 * 100 = 0.\n\nAnswer: The price of gasoline increases by 0%.",

Since it is a right trapezoid with bases $c$ and $d$, and its lateral sides are equal to $c$ and $d$, we can deduce that the two bases are equal to $c$ and $d$.\n\nSince the trapezoid is also a right trapezoid, we know that the two bases are perpendicular to each other. If we draw a diagonal from the midpoint of the base to the midpoint of the other base, we can see that it divides the trapezoid into two right triangles.\n\nIn a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side, and the other two sides are the legs.

The inequality represents the quadratic expression $x^2 - 2x - 2 - m$, and we want to find the values of $m$ that make this expression positive.\n\nWe can start by factoring the quadratic expression. Let's try to find the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 2x - 2 - m = 0$. Since the expression is negative, we know that the roots must be real numbers, and the discriminant must be non-negative.\n\nThe discriminant of the quadratic equation is given by $b^2 - 4ac$, where $a = 1$, $b = -2$, and $c = -2$.

Therefore, the roots of the quadratic equation are real numbers, and the expression $x^2 - 2x - 2 - m$ is positive for all real values of $m$.\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of $m$ that make the expression positive.

Since he uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water, and he needs 36 cups of coffee, we can set up the following equation:\n\n12 cups of weak coffee + 12 cups of strong coffee = 36 cups of coffee\n\nNow, let's find out how many tablespoons of coffee he needs to use for each type of coffee.

We know that the selling price increased by $500, so we can set up the equation:\n\nS.P. = 1.15 * C.P. + $500\n1.15 * C.P. = 1.15 * $650 + $500\n1.15 * C.P. = $732.50\n\nTo find the loss percentage, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.15 and find the decimal equivalent:\n\nLoss Percentage = (1.15 * 732.50) / 1.15\nLoss Percentage \u2248 66.95%\n\nSo, the loss percentage when the article was initially sold was approximately 66.95%.",

There are 5 plants in total, and 3 of them are selected for testing. So, the probability of selecting plant A in a week is:\n\nProbability of selecting plant A = Number of plants selected for testing / Total number of weeks\nProbability of selecting plant A = 3 / 5\n\nNow, let's find the probability of selecting both plant A and plant B in a week. We need to calculate the probability of selecting plant A first, then the probability of selecting both plants, and finally the probability of selecting both plants in a week.\n\nProbability of selecting plant A = 3 / 5\nProbability of selecting plant B = 2 / 5\n\nProbability of selecting both plants = Probability of selecting plant A * Probability of selecting plant B\nProbability of selecting both plants = (Probability of selecting plant A) * (Probability of selecting plant B)\nProbability of selecting both plants = (3 / 5) * (2 / 5)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nProbability of selecting both plants = (6 / 25)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability of selecting both plants in a week:\n\nProbability of selecting both plants in a week = (6 / 25)\nProbability of selecting both plants in a week = 0.24\n\nAnswer: 0.24",

Therefore, the domain of $g(x)$ is the set of all real numbers.\n\nThe range of $g(x)$ is the set of all possible output values of $g(x)$. Since $g(x)$ is a function, the range of $g(x)$ is a subset of the set of all real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function $y = g(x)$ on the interval $[1, 2]$ is the set of all real numbers.",

Then, their combined rate of work is x ft/hr * 6 hours = 6x ft/hr.\n\nNow, we want to find the time it takes for them to dig the hole together, which we'll call t.

Since $AC = 4$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find its length: $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = 5^2 + 3^2 = 25 + 9 = 34$.\n\nNow, we know that the length of $\\overset{\u2192}{PA}$ is the sum of the lengths of $\\overset{\u2192}{AB}$ and $\\overset{\u2192}{PB}$, which is $3 + 4 = 7$.\n\nNext, we need to find the length of $\\overset{\u2192}{PA}$ itself.

        "student_raw_output": "To find the value of the given expression, we can use the properties of arithmetic and geometric sequences. The arithmetic sequence is $\\{a_{n}\\}$, and the common difference is $d$. The geometric sequence is $\\{a_n\\}$, and the common ratio is $r = \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}$.\n\nFirst, let's find the terms of the geometric sequence. The first term is $a_1 = a_9 = a_3 = a_9$ and the common ratio is $\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{a_9}{a_3} = \\frac{a_9}{a_1} = \\frac{a_9}{a_3} = \\frac{a_9}{a_9} = 1$. This means that the geometric sequence is simply the arithmetic sequence itself.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the geometric sequence. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by $S = \\frac{n}{2} \\left( a_1 + a_n \\right)$, where $n$ is the number of terms. In this case, $n = 9$, so $S = \\frac{9}{2} \\left( a_1 + a_9 \\right) = \\frac{9}{2} \\left( a_1 + a_9 \\right) = \\frac{9}{2} \\left( a_9 + a_1 \\right) = \\frac{9}{2} \\left( 1 + a_9 \\right) = \\frac{9}{2} \\left( a_9 + a_1 \\right) = \\frac{9}{2} \\left( a_9 + 1 \\right)$.\n\nNow, we can find the value of the given expression: $\\frac{9}{2} \\left( a_9 + 1 \\right)$.

        "student_raw_output": "Let's start by breaking down the problem. The recipe calls for 12 cups of flour, 14 cups of sugar, and 7 cups of salt. We already know that Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of salt now. We can use the fact that she already put in 3 cups of salt to help us figure out how much flour she has in total.\n\nSince she already put in 3 cups of salt, and she needs 3 more cups of flour than salt, we can subtract the salt from the total amount of flour she needs to add. This will give us the amount of flour she still needs to add.\n\nWe know that the total amount of flour she needs to add is 12 + 14 + 7 = 35 cups. Since she already put in 3 cups of salt, we subtract 3 from the total amount of flour to get the amount she needs to add: 35 - 3 = 32 cups.\n\nNow, we need to add the 3 cups of salt she already put in to the amount of flour she needs to add.

Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.\n\nNow, we need to find the intervals where the inequality $x^2 - 5x - 6 \\geq 0$ holds true.

This is a binomial probability problem, and the formula for the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, plant A or plant B) in n trials (in this case, 3 local chemical plants) is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (5 local chemical plants), k is the number of successes (plant A or plant B), p is the probability of success (1/2, or 50%), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (1/2, or 50%).\n\nSo, the probability that both plant A and plant B are selected for testing in a week is:\n\nP(X = 2) = (5 choose 2) * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^3\nP(X = 2) = (5 choose 2) * (1/4) * (1/8)\nP(X = 2) = (5 choose 2) * (1/16)\nP(X = 2) = 10\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that both plant A and plant B are selected for testing in a week, given that the selection is without replacement.

        "student_raw_output": "To find the value of a \u2208 (0, \u03c0) such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) always holds true, we need to consider the behavior of the function f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) as x varies over its domain.\n\nFirst, let's examine the derivative of f(x) with respect to x. The derivative of sin(u) with respect to u is cos(u), so the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is f'(x) = cos(2x - \u03c0/4) - cos(2x - \u03c0/4) = -2sin(2x - \u03c0/4) = -2sin(x - x/2).\n\nNow, we need to show that f(x) = f(x+a) and f(x+3a) always hold true for all x. We can start by finding the difference between these two functions:\n\nf(x+a) - f(x+3a) = f(x+a) - f(x) = -2sin(2x - \u03c0/4) - 2sin(x - x/2)\n\nSince sin(2x - \u03c0/4) and sin(x - x/2) are both functions of x, we can rewrite the difference as:\n\nf(x+a) - f(x+3a) = -2sin(x - x/2)\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term sin(x) from the numerator:\n\nf(x+a) - f(x+3a) = -2sin(x)\n\nThis shows that f(x+a) - f(x+3a) always holds true, given that f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4).\n\nSince the sine function is periodic with period 2\u03c0, we can conclude that f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) is a periodic function with period 2\u03c0.\n\nNow, we can find the value of a \u2208 (0, \u03c0) such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) for all x. We can do this by taking the absolute value of the difference:\n\n|f(x+a) - f(x+3a)| = |-2sin(x) - 2sin(x/2)|\n\nSince sin(x) and sin(x/2) are both functions of x, we can rewrite the difference as:\n\n|f(x+a) - f(x+3a)| = |2sin(x/2)|\n\nSince |2sin(x/2)| = 2sin(x), we have:\n\n|f(x+a) - f(x+3a)| = 2|sin(x)|\n\nNow, we can take the absolute value of the expression:\n\n|f(x+a) - f(x+3a)| = 2|sin(x)|\n\nThis shows that f(x+a) - f(x+3a) always holds true, given that f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) is a periodic function with period 2\u03c0.\n\nSince the sine function is periodic with period 2\u03c0, we can conclude that f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) is a periodic function with period 2\u03c0, and that f(x+a) - f(x+3a) always holds true for all x.",

For example, the term 1 can be expressed as 1111 in binary, which corresponds to the power of 3 3^0 + 3^1 = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, the term 3 can be expressed as 1011 in binary, which corresponds to the power of 3 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 3 + 1 + 4 = 8.\n\nThe term 9 can be expressed as 1001 in binary, which corresponds to the power of 3 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 3 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15.\n\nThe term 10 can be expressed as 1010 in binary, which corresponds to the power of 3 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 = 3 + 1 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 22.\n\nThe term 12 can be expressed as 1100 in binary, which corresponds to the power of 3 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 3^5 = 3 + 1 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 8 = 42.\n\nThe term 13 can be expressed as 1110 in binary, which corresponds to the power of 3 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 3^5 + 3^6 = 3 + 1 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 8 + 16 = 50.\n\nWe can see that the terms of the sequence form a sequence of powers of 3, with each term being the sum of a certain number of powers of 3, in a specific order.\n\nNow, to find the 100th term, we need to find the position of the 100th term in this sequence.

The division algorithm states that if a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by another polynomial $d(x)$, then the remainder is $0$, and the quotient is given by $f(x) = (x-a)d(x) + r$. In our case, we are given that the quotient is degree $7$, and the remainder is $3x^3+4x^2-x+12$.\n\nWe can set up the equation for the remainder:\n\n$3x^3+4x^2-x+12 = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $x$ that makes this equation true. We can do this by dividing the polynomial $3x^3+4x^2-x+12$ by $x-a$, where $a$ is the value of $x$ that makes the remainder $0$.\n\nDividing $3x^3+4x^2-x+12$ by $x-a$, we get:\n\n$3x^3+4x^2-x+12 = (x-a)d(x)$\n\nNow, we can set up the equation for the quotient:\n\n$3x^3+4x^2-x+12 = 0$\n\nDividing both sides by $x-a$, we get:\n\n$3x^3 + 4x^2 + 12 = 0$\n\nThis is a cubic equation, so it can have at most three roots.

Since the degree of $3x^3+4x^2+12$ is $3$, we can divide it by $x-a$:\n\n$3x^3+4x^2+12 = (x-a)3x^2+4a$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, so it can have at most two distinct roots. Since the remainder is $3x^3+4x^2+12$, which is a polynomial of degree $3$, it must have two distinct roots.\n\nFinally, we can use Vieta's formulas to find the values of $a$ and $x$ that make the two roots distinct:\n\n$a = 4$\n\nNow that we know $a$ and $x$, we can find the value of $x$ that makes the remainder true:\n\n$x-a = 0$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$x = a$\n\nSo, the value of $a$ is $4$, and the value of $x$ is $a$.

        "student_raw_output": "To evaluate the expression $sin(\\\\frac{\u03c0}{2}-\\\\frac{\u03c0}{6})$, we can utilize the trigonometric identity $sin(a-b) = sin(a)cos(b) - cos(a)sin(b)$.\n\nFirst, we simplify the expression inside the parentheses: $\\frac{\u03c0}{2}-\\frac{\u03c0}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2-3}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute this value into the trigonometric identity: $sin(\\frac{\u03c0}{2}-\\frac{\u03c0}{6}) = sin(\\frac{1}{6})$.\n\nSince $sin(1/6) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$, the expression simplifies to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$.",

        "teacher_parsed_hint": "**Hint**: If Matt can complete his 20-problem assignment in 60 minutes faster when using a calculator, how does the time difference between using and not using a calculator for a single problem relate to the total time saved?",
        "student_raw_output": "Let's start by analyzing the information given. Matt can complete his 20-problem assignment in 60 minutes faster when using a calculator, which means the time difference between using and not using a calculator for a single problem is 60 minutes.\n\nSince Matt's assignment has 20 problems, we can calculate the time it would take him to complete 1 problem without a calculator. Since he can do 1 problem in 60 minutes, he can do 1 problem in 60/1 = 60/1 = 60 minutes.\n\nHowever, we also know that Matt's assignment has 20 problems. If he can do 1 problem in 60 minutes without a calculator, then he can do 20 problems in 20 * 60 = 1200 minutes.\n\nSince 1200 minutes is the time it would take him to complete 1 problem without a calculator, and he can do 1 problem in 60 minutes, he can do 1 problem in 60/1 = 60 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it takes Matt 60 minutes to do a problem without a calculator.",
