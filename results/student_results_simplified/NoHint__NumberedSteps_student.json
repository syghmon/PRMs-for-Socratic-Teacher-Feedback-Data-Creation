The base area is the area of the square base, which is 10x10 = 100. The height of the box is the distance between the two parallel sides of the rectangle, which is 10.

The driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline, which means the price of gasoline is increased by 10% of the original price.\n\nStep 2: Determine the original price of gasoline\nThe original price of gasoline is unknown, but we can use the given information to determine it. Since the driver intends to spend only 10% more on gasoline, we can assume that the new price of gasoline will be the same as the original price plus the increase. Let's assume the original price of gasoline is x. Then, the new price of gasoline is x + (10% of x) = x + 0.1x = x + 0.1x = 1.1x.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the new price of gasoline\nTo find the new price of gasoline, we can subtract the original price from the new price: x + 0.1x = x + 0.1x = 1.1x. Now, let's subtract the original price from the new price: 1.1x - x = 0.1x. This simplifies to 0.1x = 0.1x.\n\nStep 4: Solve for the original price of gasoline\nTo solve for the original price of gasoline, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.1: 0.1x / 0.1 = x.

We can express the derivative of $F(x)$ as $F'(x) = a(7)x^6 + b(5)x^5 + c(3)x^3 + d - 6$.\n\nStep 3: Using the fact that $F(-2) = 10$, we can rewrite the equation as $F'(2) = -2a + b + c + d = 0$.\n\nStep 4: We can rearrange the equation to get $-2a + b + c + d = 10$.\n\nStep 5: Substituting $F(-2) = 10$, we get $-2a + b + c + 10 = 0$.\n\nStep 6: We can solve for $a$ by isolating it on one side of the equation.
