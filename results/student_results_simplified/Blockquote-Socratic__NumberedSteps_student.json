    "student_raw_output": "To find the value of a \u2208 (0, \u03c0) such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) always holds true, we need to consider the behavior of the function f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) as x varies over its domain.\n\nFirst, let's examine the derivative of f(x) with respect to x. The derivative of sin(u) with respect to u is cos(u), so the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is f'(x) = cos(2x - \u03c0/4) - cos(2x - \u03c0/4) = -2sin(2x - \u03c0/4) = -2sin(x - x/2).\n\nNow, we need to show that f(x) = f(x+a) and f(x+3a) always hold true for all x. We can start by finding the difference between these two functions:\n\nf(x+a) - f(x+3a) = f(x+a) - f(x) = -2sin(2x - \u03c0/4) - 2sin(x - x/2)\n\nSince sin(2x - \u03c0/4) and sin(x - x/2) are both functions of x, we can rewrite the difference as:\n\nf(x+a) - f(x+3a) = -2sin(x - x/2)\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term sin(x) from the numerator:\n\nf(x+a) - f(x+3a) = -2sin(x)\n\nThis shows that f(x+a) - f(x+3a) always holds true, given that f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4).\n\nSince the sine function is periodic with period 2\u03c0, we can conclude that f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) is a periodic function with period 2\u03c0.\n\nNow, we can find the value of a \u2208 (0, \u03c0) such that f(x+a) = f(x+3a) for all x. We can do this by taking the absolute value of the difference:\n\n|f(x+a) - f(x+3a)| = |-2sin(x) - 2sin(x/2)|\n\nSince sin(x) and sin(x/2) are both functions of x, we can rewrite the difference as:\n\n|f(x+a) - f(x+3a)| = |2sin(x/2)|\n\nSince |2sin(x/2)| = 2sin(x), we have:\n\n|f(x+a) - f(x+3a)| = 2|sin(x)|\n\nNow, we can take the absolute value of the expression:\n\n|f(x+a) - f(x+3a)| = 2|sin(x)|\n\nThis shows that f(x+a) - f(x+3a) always holds true, given that f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) is a periodic function with period 2\u03c0.\n\nSince the sine function is periodic with period 2\u03c0, we can conclude that f(x) = sin(2x - \u03c0/4) is a periodic function with period 2\u03c0, and that f(x+a) - f(x+3a) always holds true for all x.",

In other words, we're adding a power of 3 to itself a certain number of times, in a specific order.\n\nTo understand the sequence better, let's look at the powers of 3 in ascending order: 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, \u2026\n\nEach term in the sequence can be expressed as a binary number, where each digit corresponds to a power of 3 being included or excluded from the sum. For example, the term 1 can be expressed as 1111 in binary, which corresponds to the power of 3 3^0 + 3^1 = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, the term 3 can be expressed as 1011 in binary, which corresponds to the power of 3 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 3 + 1 + 4 = 8.\n\nThe term 9 can be expressed as 1001 in binary, which corresponds to the power of 3 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 3 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15.\n\nThe term 10 can be expressed as 1010 in binary, which corresponds to the power of 3 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 = 3 + 1 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 22.\n\nThe term 12 can be expressed as 1100 in binary, which corresponds to the power of 3 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 3^5 = 3 + 1 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 8 = 42.\n\nThe term 13 can be expressed as 1110 in binary, which corresponds to the power of 3 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 3^5 + 3^6 = 3 + 1 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 8 + 16 = 50.\n\nWe can see that the terms of the sequence form a sequence of powers of 3, with each term being the sum of a certain number of powers of 3, in a specific order.\n\nNow, to find the 100th term, we need to find the position of the 100th term in this sequence.
