Since it is a right trapezoid with bases $c$ and $d$, and its lateral sides are equal to $c$ and $d$, we can deduce that the two bases are equal to $c$ and $d$.\n\nSince the trapezoid is also a right trapezoid, we know that the two bases are perpendicular to each other. If we draw a diagonal from the midpoint of the base to the midpoint of the other base, we can see that it divides the trapezoid into two right triangles.\n\nIn a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side, and the other two sides are the legs. In this case, the legs are equal to $c$ and $d$, so the hypotenuse is $c+d$. The diagonal is a line segment that connects the midpoints of the bases.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal:\n\n$c^2 + d^2 = (c+d)^2$\n\nThis equation tells us that the diagonal is the square of the sum of the lengths of the two bases.\n\nUsing the fact that the diagonal is equal to $c+d$, we can substitute it into the equation:\n\n$c^2 + d^2 = (c+d)^2$\n\nExpanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:\n\n$c^2 + d^2 = c^2 + 2cd + d^2$\n\nSubtracting $c^2$ from both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$2cd = d^2 - c^2$\n\nDividing both sides by $2$, we get:\n\n$d = c - \\frac{c^2}{2}$\n\nThis is the length of the diagonal of the trapezoid.\n\nTherefore, the bases of the original trapezoid are equal to $c$ and $d$.",

The inequality represents the quadratic expression $x^2 - 2x - 2 - m$, and we want to find the values of $m$ that make this expression positive.\n\nWe can start by factoring the quadratic expression. Let's try to find the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 2x - 2 - m = 0$. Since the expression is negative, we know that the roots must be real numbers, and the discriminant must be non-negative.\n\nThe discriminant of the quadratic equation is given by $b^2 - 4ac$, where $a = 1$, $b = -2$, and $c = -2$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get $(-2)^2 - 4(1)(-2) = 4 + 8 = 12$.\n\nSince the discriminant is non-negative, the quadratic equation has real roots. Therefore, the roots of the quadratic equation are real numbers, and the expression $x^2 - 2x - 2 - m$ is positive for all real values of $m$.\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of $m$ that make the expression positive.

    "student_raw_output": "Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that half of the guests prefer weak coffee, and the other half prefer strong coffee. We also know that Taylor uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water to make it weak.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many cups of weak coffee and strong coffee Taylor needs to make 12 cups of both types. Since he uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water, and he needs 36 cups of coffee, we can set up the following equation:\n\n12 cups of weak coffee + 12 cups of strong coffee = 36 cups of coffee\n\nNow, let's find out how many tablespoons of coffee he needs to use for each type of coffee. Since he uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water, we can set up the following equation:\n\n12 cups of weak coffee * 1 tablespoon/cup = 12 tablespoons of weak coffee\n12 cups of strong coffee * 1 tablespoon/cup = 12 tablespoons of strong coffee\n\nNow, we can set up the following equation:\n\n12 + 12 = 36\n\nSo, Taylor needs 12 + 12 = 24 tablespoons of coffee to make the weak and strong coffee.\n\nFinally, we can find the ratio of the amount of coffee used for strong coffee to the amount used for weak coffee. Since he uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water, and he needs 24 tablespoons of coffee, we can set up the following ratio:\n\n24 tablespoons of coffee / 24 tablespoons of coffee = 1:1\n\nSo, the ratio of the amount of coffee used for strong coffee to the amount used for weak coffee is 1:1.",

Since there are 7 days in a week (Saturday and Sunday), we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes can be calculated by multiplying the number of options for each day. For Saturday, there are 7 days, and for Sunday, there are also 7 days. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 7 * 7 = 49.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of students who will participate on both Saturday and Sunday. This can be done by subtracting the number of students who participate on one day from the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe number of students who will participate on Saturday is 3 students. Since there are 49 possible outcomes, the number of students who will participate on Sunday is 49 - 3 = 46.\n\nTo find the probability that there will be students participating on both Saturday and Sunday, we need to divide the number of students who will participate on both days by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe probability is therefore 46 / 49.\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.\n\nThe simplified fraction is 46 / 49.\n\nThe final answer is 46 / 49.",

This means that the roots of the quotient are not the same as the roots of the divisor.\n\nSince the degree of the quotient is $13$, we can write:\n\n$r_1 \\cdot r_2 \\cdot ... \\cdot r_n = r_1' \\cdot r_2' \\cdot ... \\cdot r_n'$,\n\nwhere $r_1', r_2', ..., r_n'$ are the roots of the quotient.\n\nNow, we can write the roots of the quotient as:\n\n$r_1 = r_1'$, $r_2 = r_1'$, ..., $r_n = r_1'$, $r_1' = r_1''$, $r_2' = r_1'$, $r_1'' = r_1'''$, ..., $r_n' = r_1'''$, $r_1'' = r_1'''$, $r_2'' = r_1'''$, $r_1''' = r_1''''$, ..., $r_n'' = r_1''''$.\n\nWe can write the product of the roots of the quotient as:\n\n$r_1 r_2 \\cdot r_3 \\cdot ... \\cdot r_n = r_1' r_2' \\cdot r_3' \\cdot ... \\cdot r_n'$.\n\nThis means that the product of the roots of the quotient is equal to the product of the roots of the divisor.\n\nHowever, we can see that $r_1$ and $r_1'$ are the same, and $r_2$ and $r_2'$ are the same, and so on.

Since Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli, Victoria has x + 2.\n\nWe know that Oli's banana split has some scoops of ice cream, so we can set up an equation using the information that Victoria has x + 2 and the total number of scoops of ice cream in Oli's banana split.\n\nLet's assume the total number of scoops of ice cream in Oli's banana split is y.

Jasmine's longest book has 396 pages, and the book in the middle of her shelf has 297 pages, which is three times the number of pages of the shortest book.\n\nThe shortest book has 396 pages, so the number of pages in the middle book must be three times the number of pages in the shortest book. Therefore, the number of pages in the middle book must be 3 * 396 = 1188.\n\nThe total number of pages in the shortest book is 396, and the total number of pages in the middle book is 1188. To find the ratio of the number of pages in the shortest book to the longest book, we can divide the number of pages in the shortest book by the number of pages in the middle book.\n\nSo, the ratio is 396 / 1188. To simplify this ratio, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12.

To find the slope of this new line, we can use the fact that the slope is the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$. The slope of the original line is $2$, and the slope of the new line is $2 - 5 = -3$. Therefore, the new slope is $-3$.\n\nThe equation of a line in the form $y = mx + b$ is $y = mx + b$.
