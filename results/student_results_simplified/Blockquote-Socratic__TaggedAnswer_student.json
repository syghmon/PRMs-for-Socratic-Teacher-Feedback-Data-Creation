    "student_raw_output": "The problem can be solved using the properties of inscribed circles and trapezoids. Let's denote the sides of the trapezoid as $c$ and $d$, and the bases as $a$ and $b$, where $a<b$.\n\nThe two smaller trapezoids can be split by the line parallel to the bases, which will divide the trapezoid into two triangles. Let's denote the radii of the inscribed circles in the two smaller trapezoids as $R_1$ and $R_2$, where $R_1<R_2$.\n\nSince the lateral sides of the trapezoid are equal to $c$ and $d$, we can write:\n\n$c+d=2R_1+2R_2$\n\n$c+d=2R_1+2R_2$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\n$R_2=R_1$\n\nThis is because the two radii of the inscribed circles are equal, which implies that the line parallel to the bases is also the height of the trapezoid.\n\nSince the two smaller trapezoids are inscribed in the trapezoid, they share the same height $c$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$R_1+R_2=c$\n\n$R_1=c-R_2$\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the smaller circle in the smaller trapezoid:\n\n$R_1=c-R_2$\n\n$R_1=c-R_2$\n\n$R_2=R_1$\n\n$R_1=R_2$\n\n$R_1=R_2$\n\n$R_1=R_2$\n\n$R_1=R_2$\n\n$R_1=R_2$\n\nNow that we have the radii of the inscribed circles in the smaller trapezoids, we can find the bases of the original trapezoid.

Therefore, the equation $x+y-m=0$ is perpendicular to the line $x+(3-2m)y=0$.\n\nSince the line is perpendicular, its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the original line. The negative reciprocal of $0$ is $-1$.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the line perpendicular to $x+(3-2m)y=0$ is $-1$.\n\nNow we can use the fact that the slope of the line perpendicular to $x+(3-2m)y=0$ is $-1$. We can find the value of $m$ by setting the slope equal to $-1$:\n\n$-1=m$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $m$ gives us:\n\n$m=-1$\n\nSo, the value of the real number $m$ is $-1$.",

So, we can set up a ratio of 1:1 for the weak and strong coffee, respectively.\n\nWe also know that Taylor uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water to make it weak, and he changes the amount for strong coffee. Let's denote the amount of coffee used for strong coffee as x. Then, the amount used for weak coffee is x/2.\n\nSince Taylor needs 36 tablespoons of coffee, we can set up the equation:\n\n1/2(x/2) + x = 36\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n1 + x = 36\n\nNow, we subtract 1 from both sides to isolate x:\n\nx = 35\n\nSo, the amount of coffee used for strong coffee is 35 tablespoons.\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the amount of coffee used for strong coffee to the amount used for weak coffee.

    "student_raw_output": "Shawn invested one half of his savings in a bond that paid simple interest for 2 years and received $550 as interest. He invested the remaining in a bond that paid compound interest, interest being compounded annually, for the same 2 years at the same rate of interest. The value of his total savings before investing in these two bonds was $2750.\n\nLet's denote the principal as P, the rate as R, and the time as T. Using the formula for compound interest, we have:\n\nA = P * (1 + R/n)^(nt)\n\nwhere A is the amount after n years, P is the principal, R is the rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n\nWe know that the total amount after 2 years is $2750, which is the sum of the principal and the interest. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\nP * (1 + R/2)^(2*2) = 2750\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nP * (1 + 1/4)^(4) = 2750\n\nNow, we can solve for P by taking the fourth root of both sides:\n\nP * (1 + 1/4)^(4) = 2750\n\n(1 + 1/4)^(4) = 2750 / 2750\n\n(1 + 1/4)^(4) = 2750 / 2750\n\n(1 + 1/4)^(4) = 1/2\n\n(1 + 1/4)^(4) = 1/2\n\n(1 + 1/4)^(4) = 1/2\n\n(1 + 1/4)^(4) = 1/2\n\n(1 + 1/4)^(4) = 1/2\n\n(1 + 1/4)^(4) = 1/2\n\n(1 + 1/4)^(4) = 1/2\n\nNow, we can find the interest by dividing the amount by the principal:\n\nInterest = (1 + 1/4)^(4) - 1\n\nInterest = (1 + 1/4)^(4) - 1\n\nInterest = (1 + 1/4)^(4) - 1\n\nInterest = (5/4)^(4) - 1\n\nInterest = (5/4)^(4) - 1\n\nInterest = (5/4)^(4) - 1\n\nInterest = (5/4)^(4) - 1\n\nInterest = (5/4)^(4) - 1\n\nInterest = (5/4)^(4) - 1\n\nNow, we can calculate the interest by multiplying the amount by the rate:\n\nInterest = (5/4) * (2750)\n\nInterest = (5/4) * (2750)\n\nInterest = 1625\n\nTherefore, Shawn received $1625 from the compound interest bond.",

The division algorithm states that if a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by another polynomial $d(x)$, then the remainder is $0$, and the quotient is given by $f(x) = (x-a)d(x) + r$. In our case, we are given that the quotient is degree $7$, and the remainder is $3x^3+4x^2-x+12$.\n\nWe can set up the equation for the remainder:\n\n$3x^3+4x^2-x+12 = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $x$ that makes this equation true.

    "ground_truth_answer": "528",
    "teacher_parsed_hint": "**Hint**: If Nell gave 276 cards to Jeff and now has 252 cards left, what does that mean in terms of the total number of cards she had before giving any to Jeff?",
    "student_raw_output": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of cards Nell had initially and the number she gave to Jeff.\n\nLet's denote the number of cards Nell had initially as x. We know that she gave 276 cards to Jeff and now has 252 cards left. So, the equation representing this situation is:\n\nx - 276 = 252\n\nHere, x represents the initial number of cards Nell had.\n\nNow, we can solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation:\n\n2x = 252\n\nTo do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n2x / 2 = 252 / 2\n\nx = 126\n\nSo, the number of cards Nell had initially is 126.\n\nThe final answer is 126.",

    "teacher_parsed_hint": "**Hint**: If Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli's and 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli, can we express the number of scoops Victoria has in terms of the number of scoops Oli has?",
    "student_raw_output": "Oli's banana split has some scoops of ice cream.\n\nLet's analyze the information given:\n- Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli's.\n- Victoria has 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli.\n\nWe can express Victoria's number of scoops of ice cream in terms of Oli's number of scoops of ice cream. Since Oli's number of scoops of ice cream is twice more than Victoria's, we can express Victoria's number of scoops of ice cream as 2 times Oli's number of scoops of ice cream.\n\nSo, Victoria's number of scoops of ice cream = 2 * Oli's number of scoops of ice cream.\n\nNow, we can substitute Victoria's number of scoops of ice cream into the expression for Oli's banana split:\n\nOli's banana split has some scoops of ice cream.\n\nLet's calculate Victoria's number of scoops of ice cream:\n- Victoria has 2 * Oli's number of scoops of ice cream.\n- Victoria has 2 * (2 * Oli's number of scoops of ice cream).\n- Victoria has 2 * 2 * Oli's number of scoops of ice cream.\n- Victoria has 2 * 2 * (2 * Oli's number of scoops of ice cream).\n- Victoria has 2 * 2 * 2 * Oli's number of scoops of ice cream.\n- Victoria has 2 * 2 * 2 * (2 * Oli's number of scoops of ice cream).\n- Victoria has 2 * 2 * 2 * (2 * (2 * Oli's number of scoops of ice cream)).\n- Victoria has 2 * 2 * 2 * (2 * 2 * Oli's number of scoops of ice cream).\n- Victoria has 2 * 2 * 2 * (2 * 2 * 2 * Oli's number of scoops of ice cream).\n- Victoria has 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * Oli's number of scoops of ice cream.\n\nSince we want to find the total number of scoops of ice cream, we can add up all the possible combinations:\n\nOli's banana split has some scoops of ice cream.\n\nSo, the total number of scoops of ice cream is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * Oli's number of scoops of ice cream.\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of Oli's number of scoops of ice cream to find the final answer:\n\nOli's banana split has some scoops of ice cream.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * Oli's number of scoops of ice cream.",

    "teacher_parsed_hint": "**Hint**: If you square both equations (sum and difference) and subtract one from the other, what can you infer about the relationship between the two equations?",
    "student_raw_output": "To solve this problem, let's start by recalling the formula for the sum and difference of squares:\n\nSum of Squares = n^2 + (n-1)^2\nDifference of Squares = n^2 - (n-1)^2\n\nwhere n is a number.\n\nWe are given that the sum of the two numbers is 20 and their difference is some value. Let's denote the value as x. Then, we have:\n\n20 = n^2 + (n-1)^2\n\nNow, let's subtract (n-1)^2 from both sides of the equation:\n\n20 - (n-1)^2 = n^2 + (n-1)^2\n\nExpanding the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n20 - (n-1)^2 = n^2 + n^2 - 2n + 1\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n20 - (n-1)^2 = n^2 + n^2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n20 - (n-1)^2 = n^2 + n^2\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to isolate n^2:\n\n(n-1)^2 = 20 - 20\n(n-1)^2 = 0\n\nSince n-1 is always 0, we can conclude that n-1 = 0. This means n = 1.\n\nNow that we know n = 1, we can substitute this value into the sum of squares equation:\n\n20 = 1^2 + (1-1)^2\n20 = 1 + 0\n20 = 1\n\nSo, the value of n is 1.\n\nNow, let's find the difference of squares:\n\n200 = n^2 - (1)^2\n\nSubtracting (1)^2 from both sides:\n\n200 = n^2 - 1\n\nAdding 1 to both sides:\n\n201 = n^2\n\nNow, we can solve for n:\n\nn^2 = 201\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nn = \u221a201\n\nn = 14.14\n\nSo, the two numbers are 1 and 14.14.",
