    "student_raw_output": "In a trapezoid, the bases are parallel to each other, and the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. Since the bases are equal to $c$ and $d$, we know that the sides of the trapezoid are also equal to $c$ and $d$.\n\nLet's denote the lengths of the bases as $a$ and $b$, and the height of the trapezoid as $h$. According to the problem, the bases of the trapezoid are parallel to each other, so $a = b$.\n\nThe diagonals of the trapezoid bisect each other at their points of intersection, which are the midpoints of the bases. Let's denote the lengths of the diagonals as $a$ and $b$.\n\nNow, let's consider the trapezoid and its right triangle formed by the height of the trapezoid and the height of the right triangle formed by the bases of the trapezoid. Since the bases of the trapezoid are equal to $c$ and $d$, the height of the right triangle formed by the bases is $c$ or $d$.\n\nHowever, if the height of the right triangle is $c$, then the altitude of the trapezoid is $c$, which is not the case since $c < d$. If the height of the right triangle is $d$, then the altitude of the trapezoid is $d$, which is again not the case since $c < d$.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the height of the right triangle formed by the bases of the trapezoid is $c$, but we cannot determine the value of $c$ without more information.\n\nIn conclusion, the bases of the original trapezoid are $a = c$ and $b = c$.",

    "student_raw_output": "Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. We know that their sum is 20, so we can write:\n\nx + y = 20\n\nThe difference of their squares is given as 200. We can write this as:\n\n(x - y)^2 = 200\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get:\n\nx^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 200\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 200 - 2xy\n\nNow, we want to find the difference between the two numbers. We can write this as:\n\n(x - y)^2 - 2xy = 200 - 2xy\n\nFactoring out the difference of squares, we get:\n\n(x - y)^2 - 2xy(x - y) = 200 - 2xy\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get:\n\n(x - y)^2 - 2xy(x - y) + 2xy = 200 - 2xy\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n(x - y)^2 - 2xy(x - y) = 200 - 2xy - 2xy\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n(x - y)^2 = 200 - 2xy\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nx - y = \u00b1\u221a(200 - 2xy)\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the two numbers. We can write this as:\n\nx - y = \u00b1\u221a(200 - 2xy)\n\nSince x and y are integers, we can choose a suitable value for xy. Let's say xy = 100. Then:\n\nx - y = \u00b1\u221a(200 - 2*100) = \u00b1\u221a(100) = \u00b110\n\nSo, the possible values for x and y are:\n\nx = 10, y = 10\n\nx = 10, y = -10\n\nSince the problem only asks for the difference between the two numbers, we can conclude that the two possible values are:\n\nx = 10, y = 10\n\nThe difference between the two numbers is:\n\n(10 - 10) = 0\n\nSo, the difference between the two numbers is 0.",
