The cosine function has a minimum value of -1. This occurs when the angle between the vectors is 180 degrees (they point in opposite directions).\n\n**Geometric Interpretation**\n\n*  Imagine point P on side BC. \n*  For the dot product to be minimized, vectors $\\overrightarrow{PA}$ and $\\overrightarrow{PB}$ should point in roughly opposite directions. This happens when P is at one of the endpoints of BC (B or C).\n\n**Solution**\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $\\overrightarrow{PA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{PB}$ occurs when P is at either point B or C.

This maximizes the cosine term in the dot product formula, making the dot product negative.\n* As P moves along BC, the angle between the vectors decreases, and the dot product becomes less negative (closer to zero).\n\n**Step 4:  Determine the minimum.**\n\nThe minimum value of the dot product occurs when the vectors $\\overrightarrow{PA}$ and $\\overrightarrow{PB}$ are as close to being in the same direction as possible.

Start by rearranging the terms: \n $$x^2 - 2x - 2 - m = (x^2 - 2x) - 2 - m$$\n\nStep 2: **Find the constant to complete the square.** Take half of the coefficient of our $x$ term (-2), square it ((-1)^2 = 1), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:\n$$(x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1) - 2 - m$$\n\nStep 3: **Rewrite as a squared term.** The expression inside the parentheses is now a perfect square trinomial:\n$$(x - 1)^2 - 1 - 2 - m$$\n\nStep 4: **Simplify.** Combine the constants:\n$$(x - 1)^2 - 3 - m$$\n\nStep 5: **Consider the inequality.** We want to find the values of $m$ for which the inequality $x^2 - 2x - 2 - m < 0$ holds.  Since the coefficient of the squared term is positive, the parabola opens upwards. This means the inequality holds when the expression is negative, which occurs between the roots of the quadratic.\n\nStep 6: **Analyze the vertex.**  The vertex of the parabola is at $(1,-3-m)$. Since the parabola opens upwards, the inequality holds for values of $x$ between the roots.  \n\nStep 7: **Use the interval [2, 4].** We know  $x \\in [2, 4]$. This means the parabola must intersect the x-axis somewhere within this interval.  Since the vertex is at $(1,-3-m)$,  and the parabola opens upwards, the inequality will hold for values of $m$ such that the parabola intersects the x-axis within the interval [2, 4].  \n\nStep 8: **Determine the range of m.** To find the exact range of $m$, we'd need to solve for the roots of the equation $(x - 1)^2 - 3 - m = 0$ and see where they fall within the interval [2, 4].  This would involve solving a quadratic equation and analyzing the solutions. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to work through the quadratic equation and find the precise range of $m$. \n",
      "Here's the solution:\n\nStep 1: **Complete the square.** \nBegin by focusing on the quadratic expression:  $x^2 - 2x - 2 - m$.

Since the quadratic is always positive or zero for values of $x$ outside this interval, the solution $m > -3$ holds for the entire domain.\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{m > -3}"

To minimize this sum, we should try to make the terms under the square roots as small as possible.\n\n**Step 3:  Consider the terms under the square roots**\n\n*  x\u00b2 + 1 \u2265 1  for all real numbers x\n*  y\u00b2 + 1 \u2265 1 for all real numbers y\n\nTherefore, \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1) \u2265 1 and \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1) \u2265 1.\n\n**Step 4:  Apply the minimum values**\n\nSince the square roots are greater than or equal to 1, the terms x\u221a(y\u00b2 + 1) and y\u221a(x\u00b2 + 1) are greater than or equal to x and y, respectively. \n\n**Step 5:  Simplify the inequality**\n\nUsing the information from Step 4, we can simplify the inequality:\n\nxy + x\u221a(y\u00b2 + 1) + y\u221a(x\u00b2 + 1) + \u221a((x\u00b2 + 1)(y\u00b2 + 1)) \u2265 1\n\nxy + x + y + \u221a((x\u00b2 + 1)(y\u00b2 + 1)) \u2265 1\n\n**Step 6:  Minimize x + y**\n\nTo minimize x + y, we need to find the smallest possible values for x and y while still satisfying the inequality.  \n\nSince \u221a((x\u00b2 + 1)(y\u00b2 + 1)) is always non-negative, the inequality is satisfied when:\n\nxy + x + y \u2265 1\n\n**Step 7:  Complete the square**\n\nTo make it easier to find the minimum, complete the square for x and y:\n\nxy + x + y + 1/4 \u2265 1 + 1/4\n\n(x + 1/2)(y + 1/2) \u2265 5/4\n\n**Step 8:  Interpret the result**\n\nThe inequality (x + 1/2)(y + 1/2) \u2265 5/4 tells us that the product of (x + 1/2) and (y + 1/2) must be at least 5/4.  \n\nTo minimize x + y, we want to make x + 1/2 and y + 1/2 as small as possible while still satisfying the inequality.  This occurs when they are equal to the square roots of 5/4.\n\nTherefore:\n\nx + 1/2 = \u221a(5/4)  =>  x = \u221a(5/4) - 1/2\n\ny + 1/2 = \u221a(5/4)  =>  y = \u221a(5/4) - 1/2\n\n**Step 9:  Calculate the minimum value**\n\nFinally, calculate the minimum value of x + y:\n\nx + y = (\u221a(5/4) - 1/2) + (\u221a(5/4) - 1/2) \n\n      = 2\u221a(5/4) - 1\n\n      = \u221a5 - 1\n\n\n\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{5} - 1} \n\n\n\n\n",
      "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\nStep 1: Expand the product on the left-hand side of the inequality:\n  \n  (x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))(y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1)) \u2265 1\n  xy + x\u221a(y\u00b2 + 1) + y\u221a(x\u00b2 + 1) + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1)\u221a(y\u00b2 + 1) \u2265 1\n\nStep 2:  Notice that we want to minimize x + y.  Let's try to manipulate the expanded inequality to isolate x + y.  \n\nStep 3:  Unfortunately, there's no straightforward way to directly isolate x + y.  The problem might be designed to be tricky or require a more advanced approach.  \n\nStep 4:  At this point, it's helpful to consider the structure of the inequality. The terms  \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1) and \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1)  are always non-negative.  This suggests that the minimum value of the left-hand side might occur when these terms are as small as possible.\n\nStep 5:  However, the terms \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1) and \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1) are minimized when x and y are as close to zero as possible.  This doesn't necessarily lead to a direct solution for the minimum value of x + y.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile we've made some progress, finding the exact minimum value of x + y in this inequality seems to require more advanced techniques or a clever substitution. \n"

      "Here's the solution:\n\nStep 1: Since the sum of the house numbers is 117, we know there's an equal number of houses on each side of the street.\n\nStep 2:  Let's assume there are 'n' houses on each side of the street. The sum of the house numbers on one side would be the sum of an arithmetic series with the first term being 1 and the common difference being 1.\n\nStep 3: The sum of an arithmetic series is (n/2)(first term + last term).  In this case, the sum is 117, and the first term is 1.  So, we have: (n/2)(1 + last term) = 117\n\nStep 4:  The last term is 'n'. Substituting this into the equation, we get: (n/2)(1 + n) = 117\n\nStep 5: Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: n(1 + n) = 234\n\nStep 6: Expanding the equation, we get: n + n\u00b2 = 234\n\nStep 7: Rearranging into a quadratic equation: n\u00b2 + n - 234 = 0\n\nStep 8: Factoring the quadratic equation: (n + 16)(n - 14) = 0\n\nStep 9: Solving for n, we get two possible solutions: n = -16 or n = 14. Since the number of houses cannot be negative, we discard n = -16.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, there are 14 houses on each side of the street.\n\n\nStep 11: The fifth house from the beginning is the fifth number in the arithmetic sequence.\n\nStep 12: The fifth term in an arithmetic sequence is found by: first term + (number of terms - 1) * common difference\n\nStep 13: In this case, the fifth term is: 1 + (5-1) * 1 = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{5} \n",

We can express the sum of the first four house numbers as a + (a+1) + (a+2) + (a+3) = 4a + 6.\n\nStep 6: The average of the first four house numbers is (4a + 6) / 4 = a + 1.5\n\nStep 7: The average of the first and last house numbers is (a + 117/number of houses) / 2\n\nStep 8: Equating the two averages, we get a + 1.5 = (a + 117/number of houses) / 2.\n\nStep 9: Since the number of houses is odd, we can't directly solve for 'a' and the fifth house number without more information. \n\n\n\n",

      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the weight of the bag that is cut into 2-meter pieces:** The bag is 5 meters long, and we're cutting it into 2-meter pieces. This means we'll have 5/2 = 2.5 pieces.  Since the whole bag weighs 29/8 kg, each 2-meter piece will weigh (29/8 kg) / 2.5 = 29/20 kg.\n\n2. **Calculate the weight of the chair that is cut into 2-meter pieces:** The chair is 4 meters long, and we're cutting it into 2-meter pieces. This means we'll have 4/2 = 2 pieces. Each 2-meter piece of the chair will weigh 2.8 kg / 2 = 1.4 kg.\n\n3. **Calculate the total weight of the cut pieces:** The total weight of the cut pieces is (29/20 kg) * 2.5 + (1.4 kg) * 2 = 29/8 kg + 2.8 kg.\n\n4. **Simplify the total weight:**  To add the fractions, we need a common denominator.

The point $M$ can be anywhere within the square.  \n\n5. **Favorable Outcomes:**  The favorable outcomes are those where point $M$ is chosen in a way that creates a triangle $MCD$ with an area less than $S/3$.  This corresponds to a region within the parallelogram.\n\n6. **Calculating the Probability:**  \n   * The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total possible outcomes.\n   * The total possible outcomes are all the points within the parallelogram (the entire area of the parallelogram).\n   * The favorable outcomes are a smaller region within the parallelogram.\n\n   Since we're dealing with a probability, we can think of this as a ratio of areas:\n\n   Probability = (Area of favorable region) / (Area of parallelogram)\n\n   We know the area of the parallelogram is $S$.  The area of the favorable region is $S/3$ (since we want the triangle's area to be less than $S/3$).\n\n   Therefore, the probability is: \n   \n   Probability = ($S/3$) / ($S$) = **1/3**.\n\n\n\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}"

This range falls within one standard deviation above the mean.\n\n5. **Estimate the Percentage:** Since about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, we can estimate that approximately **68%** of the students scored between 80 and 90 points.\n\n6. **Calculate the Number of Students:**\n   * Multiply the percentage by the total number of students: 0.68 * 48 = 32.64\n\n7. **Round to the Nearest Whole Number:** Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round to the nearest whole number.\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{33} students. \n",
