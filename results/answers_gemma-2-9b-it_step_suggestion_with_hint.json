To keep the left-hand side smaller than n(x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074), we need 'n' to be relatively large.\n\nStep 5:  A good strategy is to try to bound the product terms.  We can use the AM-GM inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of non-negative numbers is greater than or equal to their geometric mean. Applying this to our product terms:\n\n  * 2x\u00b2y\u00b2 \u2264 (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\u00b2 \n  * 2x\u00b2z\u00b2 \u2264 (x\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\u00b2 \n  * 2y\u00b2z\u00b2 \u2264 (y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\u00b2\n\nStep 6:  Substitute these bounds back into the inequality:\n\n  (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\u00b2 \u2264 n(x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074) \n  x\u2074 + (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\u00b2 + (y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\u00b2 + y\u2074 + z\u2074 \u2264 n(x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074)\n\nStep 7:  Notice that we can write:\n\n  (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\u00b2 = x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074 + 2(x\u00b2y\u00b2 + x\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u00b2z\u00b2) \n\nStep 8:  Substitute this back into the inequality:\n\n  x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074 + 2(x\u00b2y\u00b2 + x\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u00b2z\u00b2) \u2264 n(x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074)\n\nStep 9:  Rearrange the inequality:\n\n  2(x\u00b2y\u00b2 + x\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u00b2z\u00b2) \u2264 n(x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074) - (x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074)\n\nStep 10: Simplify:\n\n  2(x\u00b2y\u00b2 + x\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u00b2z\u00b2) \u2264 (n-1)(x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074)\n\nStep 11:  To ensure the inequality holds for all real values of x, y, and z, we need the right-hand side to be as small as possible.  The smallest natural number 'n' that makes this work is **n = 2**.\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{2}"

      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n**1.  Represent the house numbers:**\n\n* Let 'a' be the house number of the first house.\n* The house numbers on the street form an arithmetic sequence: a, a+1, a+2, ...\n\n**2. Set up the equation:**\n\n* The sum of an arithmetic series is (n/2)(first term + last term), where 'n' is the number of terms.\n* We know the sum is 117 and there are 'n' terms.  We need to figure out the last term.\n\n**3.  Find the last term:**\n\n* Since we don't know 'n', we can't directly find the last term.  \n\n**4.  Analyze the problem:**\n\n* We're only interested in the fifth house number, not the entire sum.  This means we can focus on a smaller part of the sequence.\n\n**5.

We don't have enough information:**\n\n*  We can't determine the exact value of 'a' (the first house number) or the fifth house number without more information about the number of houses on the street. \n\n\n\n**Answer:** We cannot determine the house number of the fifth house from the given information. \n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\nStep 1: **Represent the house numbers:** Let's assume the house numbers are consecutive integers.  Since we don't know the starting house number, we can represent it as 'x'.  The house numbers would then be x, x+1, x+2, ...\n\nStep 2: **Set up the equation:** The sum of all the house numbers is 117. We can express this as an equation:\nx + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x + n-1) = 117, where 'n' is the total number of houses.\n\nStep 3: **Simplify the equation:**  The sum of an arithmetic series is (n/2)(first term + last term).  In this case:\n(n/2)(x + x + n - 1) = 117\n\nStep 4: **We need to find 'n':**  We don't know the total number of houses 'n'.  However, we know we want the 5th house number.

Therefore, 1/tan \u03b8 = cos \u03b8 / sin \u03b8.\n\n5. **Express the target expression:** We want to find tan \u03b8 + 1/tan \u03b8 = (sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8) + (cos \u03b8 / sin \u03b8).\n\n6. **Find a common denominator:**  The common denominator is sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8.

For any other real number value of x, 2^x will be a decimal.\n\n3. **Considering the Equation:**  Let's examine the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0.  \n\n   *  If x is a non-negative integer, then 2^x is also an integer. This means 2[x] will be an integer multiple of 2.  The equation can then be rewritten as 2^x - 2k - 1 = 0, where k is an integer.  \n\n   *  If x is not a non-negative integer, then 2^x is not an integer. The equation will not have an integer solution.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 has solutions only when x is a non-negative integer. Since there are infinitely many non-negative integers, there are **infinitely many** solutions. \n\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{\\text{infinitely many}} \n",
      "Here's the solution:\n\nStep 1: **Analyze the greatest integer function:** The function [x] gives the largest integer less than or equal to x.  \n\nStep 2: **Consider the behavior of 2^x:** The function 2^x produces integer values only when x is an integer.  \n\nStep 3: **Combine the information:** This means that for the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 to hold true, x must be an integer.\n\nStep 4: **Test integer values:**  We need to check if there are any integer values of x that satisfy the equation.  \n\nUnfortunately, there's no straightforward way to algebraically solve for x in this equation. We'd need to try different integer values and see if they work. \n\nStep 5: **Conclusion:** Without further testing, we can't definitively say how many integer solutions exist. \n\n\nLet me know if you want to explore specific integer values to see if they work! \n"

    "problem": "A leak in the bottom of a tank can empty the full tank in 3 hours. There are two inlet pipes which can fill the tank. Inlet Pipe A fills water at the rate of 6 litres a minute, while Inlet Pipe B fills the tank at a rate of 4 litres a minute. Both inlet pipes are opened simultaneously when the tank is full, and due to the leak, the tank is empty in 12 hours. How many litres does the cistern hold?",
