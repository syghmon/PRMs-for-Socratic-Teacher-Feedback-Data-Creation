Notice that:\n\n* x\u00b2y\u00b2, x\u00b2z\u00b2, and y\u00b2z\u00b2 are always non-negative.\n* x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074 is always non-negative.\n\nStep 6: To make the inequality hold for all values, the right-hand side must be as large as possible.  The smallest value of *n* that achieves this is *n = 2*.\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{n=2}",
      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Expand the left-hand side:**\n   \n   Begin by expanding the square on the left side of the inequality:\n   \n   (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\u00b2 = x\u2074 + 2x\u00b2y\u00b2 + 2x\u00b2z\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u2074 + z\u2074\n\n2. **Rewrite the inequality:**\n\n   Now the inequality looks like this:\n   \n   x\u2074 + 2x\u00b2y\u00b2 + 2x\u00b2z\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u2074 + z\u2074 \u2264 n(x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074)\n\n3. **Analyze the relationship:**\n\n   Notice that the left side has terms like 2x\u00b2y\u00b2, 2x\u00b2z\u00b2, and 2y\u00b2z\u00b2, which are not present on the right side.  This suggests that we need to find a value for 'n' that will make the left side smaller than or equal to the right side for all possible values of x, y, and z.\n\n4. **Consider the AM-GM inequality:**\n\n   The Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality states that for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean.  We can apply this to our problem:\n\n   *  (x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074) / 3 \u2265 (x\u00b2y\u00b2z\u00b2)^(1/3) \n\n   Multiplying both sides by 3 and taking the cube of both sides, we get:\n\n   * x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074 \u2265 3x\u00b2y\u00b2z\u00b2\n\n5. **Substitute and solve for n:**\n\n   Substitute the AM-GM result back into our inequality:\n\n   x\u2074 + 2x\u00b2y\u00b2 + 2x\u00b2z\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u2074 + z\u2074 \u2264 n(x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074)\n   \n   x\u2074 + 2x\u00b2y\u00b2 + 2x\u00b2z\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u2074 + z\u2074 \u2264 n(3x\u00b2y\u00b2z\u00b2)\n\n   Notice that we can rewrite the left side as:\n\n   x\u2074 + 2x\u00b2y\u00b2 + 2x\u00b2z\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u2074 + z\u2074 = (x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074) + 2(x\u00b2y\u00b2 + x\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u00b2z\u00b2)\n\n   Now, since x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074 \u2265 3x\u00b2y\u00b2z\u00b2, we have:\n\n   (x\u2074 + y\u2074 + z\u2074) + 2(x\u00b2y\u00b2 + x\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u00b2z\u00b2) \u2265 3x\u00b2y\u00b2z\u00b2 + 2(x\u00b2y\u00b2 + x\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u00b2z\u00b2)\n\n   Simplifying the right side:\n\n   3x\u00b2y\u00b2z\u00b2 + 2(x\u00b2y\u00b2 + x\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u00b2z\u00b2) = x\u00b2y\u00b2 + x\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u00b2z\u00b2 + 3x\u00b2y\u00b2z\u00b2\n\n   Therefore, to satisfy the inequality, we need:\n\n   n \u2265 (x\u00b2y\u00b2 + x\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u00b2z\u00b2 + 3x\u00b2y\u00b2z\u00b2) / (3x\u00b2y\u00b2z\u00b2)\n\n   The smallest natural number 'n' that satisfies this inequality for all real values of x, y, and z is  **n = 2**.\n\n\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{2}"

Notice that we can rewrite this as:\n $$3a + b = 3a - 3 + 3 + b = 3(a - 1) + (b - 1) + 3$$\n\nStep 8: **Use the circle equation:**  Since $(3a - 3)^2 + (b - 1)^2 = 10$, the maximum value of  $(3a - 3)^2 + (b - 1)^2$ is 10.  This occurs when $(3a - 3)^2 = 10$ and $(b - 1)^2 = 0$.\n\nStep 9: **Solve for the maximum value:**  \n*  $(3a - 3)^2 = 10$ implies $3a - 3 = \\pm \\sqrt{10}$, so $3a = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{10}$.\n* $(b - 1)^2 = 0$ implies $b - 1 = 0$, so $b = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of $3a + b$ is:\n$$3(a - 1) + (b - 1) + 3 = 3\\left(\\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{10}}{3} - 1\\right) + (1 - 1) + 3 = \\boxed{3 \\pm \\sqrt{10}}$$ \n\n\n\n",

The maximum value will occur when the inequality is an equality, which means maximizing xy.\n\n  The maximum value of xy is achieved when x and y are equal.  Solving for x and y in terms of each other:\n\n  x = y\n\n  Substituting into 9x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 2:\n\n  9x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 2\n\n  10x\u00b2 = 2\n\n  x\u00b2 = 1/5\n\n  x = \u00b1\u221a(1/5)\n\n  Since x = y, we have y = \u00b1\u221a(1/5)\n\n  Substituting these values into (3x + y + 1)\u00b2:\n\n  (3x + y + 1)\u00b2 = 9(1/5) + (1/5) + 6x\u221a(1/5) + 2\u221a(1/5) + 6x + 1\n\n  Simplifying and maximizing the expression will give you the maximum value of 3a + b.\n\n\n\nAnswer:  ______ (You'll need to complete the simplification steps above to find the final numerical answer).\n",

For values of x between integers, [x] will be the integer less than x.\n\nStep 2: **Consider the behavior of 2^x:** The exponential function 2^x produces integer values only when x is an integer.  This is because raising 2 to a non-integer power results in a non-integer value.\n\nStep 3: **Combine the information:**  Since 2^x is an integer only when x is an integer, the equation 2^x - 2[x] - 1 = 0 will only hold true when x is an integer.  \n\nStep 4: **Solve for integer values of x:**  We need to find the integer values of x that satisfy the equation.

Therefore, the left side of the equation approaches negative infinity.\n\n* As x approaches positive infinity, 2^x grows exponentially, while -2x grows linearly. This means the left side of the equation will approach positive infinity.\n\nStep 5:  Since the function changes sign (from negative to positive) as x increases, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that there is at least one solution to the equation 2^x - 2x - 1 = 0.\n\nStep 6:  Furthermore, the function is strictly increasing for positive values of x.

Since k can be any integer, we need to find the smallest positive value of 'a' that satisfies the equations.\n\nStep 8:  From the first equation, a = -\u03c0k/2, the smallest positive value of 'a' occurs when k = -2, giving us a = \u03c0.

Since  *a* and *b* are positive, we'll use $\\frac{a}{b} = 2$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Parabola Information:**\n\n* The standard equation of a parabola with its vertex at the origin and opening upwards is  $x^2 = 4py$.\n* We are given $x^2 = 4\\sqrt{10}y$.\n* Comparing the two equations, we see that $4p = 4\\sqrt{10}$, so $p = \\sqrt{10}$.\n* The focus of a parabola with this standard form is located at $(0, p)$, which means the focus of this parabola is $(0, \\sqrt{10})$.\n\n**3. Connect the Hyperbola and Parabola:**\n\n* We are told that one focus of the hyperbola coincides with the focus of the parabola. \n* Therefore, the focus of the hyperbola is $(0, \\sqrt{10})$.\n\n**4. Determine the Value of *a*:**\n\n* For a hyperbola with a vertical transverse axis, the distance from the center to each focus is *c*.\n* We know the focus is at $(0, \\sqrt{10})$, so *c* = $\\sqrt{10}$.\n* We also know that  $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.\n\n* Substitute the value of *c* and the relationship between *a* and *b*  to solve for *a*:\n   * $(\\sqrt{10})^2 = a^2 + b^2$\n   * $10 = a^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2$\n   * $10 = a^2 + \\frac{a^2}{4}$\n   * $\\frac{40}{4} = \\frac{4a^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4}$\n   * $\\frac{40}{4} = \\frac{5a^2}{4}$\n   * $40 = 5a^2$\n   * $a^2 = 8$\n   * $a = 2\\sqrt{2}$ (We take the positive root since *a* is positive)\n\n**5.

      "Here's the solution:\n\nStep 1: **Express  a\u2083 and a\u2089 in terms of a\u2081 and d:**\n*  We know that in an arithmetic sequence, each term is found by adding the common difference to the previous term.\n*  Therefore,  a\u2083 = a\u2081 + 2d and a\u2089 = a\u2081 + 8d.\n\nStep 2: **Recognize the geometric sequence relationship:**\n*  The problem states that a\u2081, a\u2083, and a\u2089 form a geometric sequence. This means that the ratio between any two consecutive terms is constant.\n\nStep 3: **Set up the geometric sequence equation:**\n*  We can write the geometric sequence relationship as: \n    *  a\u2083 / a\u2081 = a\u2089 / a\u2083\n\nStep 4: **Substitute the expressions for a\u2083 and a\u2089:**\n*  (a\u2081 + 2d) / a\u2081 = (a\u2081 + 8d) / (a\u2081 + 2d)\n\nStep 5: **Solve for d:**\n*  Cross-multiply: (a\u2081 + 2d)\u00b2 = a\u2081(a\u2081 + 8d)\n*  Expand: a\u2081\u00b2 + 4a\u2081d + 4d\u00b2 = a\u2081\u00b2 + 8a\u2081d\n*  Simplify: -4a\u2081d = -4d\u00b2\n*  Divide both sides by -4d (assuming d \u2260 0): a\u2081 = d\n\nStep 6: **Find the expression for a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2081\u2080:**\n*  a\u2082 = a\u2081 + d = a\u2081 + a\u2081 = 2a\u2081\n*  a\u2084 = a\u2081 + 3d = a\u2081 + 3a\u2081 = 4a\u2081\n*  a\u2081\u2080 = a\u2081 + 9d = a\u2081 + 9a\u2081 = 10a\u2081\n*  Therefore, a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2081\u2080 = 2a\u2081 + 4a\u2081 + 10a\u2081 = 16a\u2081\n\nStep 7: **Calculate the value of (a\u2081 + a\u2083 + a\u2089) / (a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2081\u2080):**\n*  a\u2081 + a\u2083 + a\u2089 = a\u2081 + (a\u2081 + 2d) + (a\u2081 + 8d) = 3a\u2081 + 10d \n*  Substitute a\u2081 = d: 3d + 10d = 13d\n*  Therefore, (a\u2081 + a\u2083 + a\u2089) / (a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2081\u2080) = 13d / 16d = **\\boxed{\\frac{13}{16}}**. \n\n\n\n"
