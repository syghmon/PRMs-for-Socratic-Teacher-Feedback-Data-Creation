This suggests trying to manipulate it to resemble a known inequality or identity.\n\n2. **Consider AM-GM:** The Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality states that for non-negative numbers a and b:\n   (a + b)/2 \u2265 \u221a(ab)\n\n3. **Apply AM-GM:**  Let's apply AM-GM to the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n   *  (x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))/2 \u2265 \u221a(x * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))\n   *  (y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))/2 \u2265 \u221a(y * \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))\n\n4. **Multiply the Inequalities:** Multiplying these inequalities, we get:\n\n   [(x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))/2] * [(y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))/2] \u2265 \u221a(x * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1)) * \u221a(y * \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))\n\n5. **Simplify:** This simplifies to:\n\n   (x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))(y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))/4 \u2265 \u221a(xy\u221a(x\u00b2 + 1)\u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))\n\n6. **Relate to the Original Inequality:**  We want to find the minimum value of x + y. Notice that our simplified inequality is very close to the original inequality.  We can rewrite it as:\n\n   (x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))(y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1)) \u2265 4\u221a(xy\u221a(x\u00b2 + 1)\u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))\n\n7. **Minimize the Right Side:** To minimize the right side, we need to minimize xy\u221a(x\u00b2 + 1)\u221a(y\u00b2 + 1).  \n\n   * AM-GM again tells us \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1) \u2265 \u221ax and \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1) \u2265 \u221ay.\n   * Therefore, xy\u221a(x\u00b2 + 1)\u221a(y\u00b2 + 1) \u2265 xy * \u221ax * \u221ay = xy\u221a(xy)\n\n8. **Further Minimization:**  To minimize xy\u221a(xy), we can again use AM-GM:\n\n   * (x + y)/2 \u2265 \u221a(xy)\n\n   * Squaring both sides: (x + y)\u00b2/4 \u2265 xy\n   *  Therefore, xy\u221a(xy) \u2264 (x + y)\u00b2/4 * \u221a(xy)\n\n9. **Combine Results:** Putting everything together, we have:\n   (x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))(y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1)) \u2265 4\u221a[(x + y)\u00b2/4 * \u221a(xy)]\n   (x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))(y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1)) \u2265 (x + y)\u221a(xy)\n\n10. **Solve for Minimum:** The inequality above holds for all x and y satisfying the original condition. To minimize x + y, we need to minimize the right side.  Since the left side is always greater than or equal to the right side, the minimum value of x + y occurs when the right side is minimized.  This happens when x = y.\n\n11. **Final Steps:**  Substitute x = y into the AM-GM inequality we derived earlier:\n\n    (x + x)/2 \u2265 \u221a(x * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))\n    x \u2265 \u221a(x\u00b3 + x)\n\n    Squaring both sides: x\u00b2 \u2265 x\u00b3 + x\n    x\u00b3 + x - x\u00b2 \u2264 0\n    x(x\u00b2 + 1 - x) \u2264 0\n\n    This inequality holds when 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1.\n\n    Therefore, the minimum value of x + y is achieved when x = y = 0.5.\n\n\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{1}",
      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n1. **AM-GM Inequality:** Recall the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, which states that for non-negative numbers *a* and *b*:\n   \n   (a + b)/2 \u2265 \u221a(a * b)\n\n2. **Apply AM-GM:**  Let's apply AM-GM to the terms inside the parentheses of the inequality:\n\n   *  (x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))/2 \u2265 \u221a(x * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1)) \n   *  (y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))/2 \u2265 \u221a(y * \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))\n\n3. **Multiply the Inequalities:** Multiply the two inequalities we obtained:\n\n   [(x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))/2] * [(y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))/2] \u2265 \u221a(x * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1)) * \u221a(y * \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))\n\n4. **Simplify:** This simplifies to:\n\n   (x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))(y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))/4 \u2265 \u221a(x * y * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1) * \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))\n\n5. **Use the Given Inequality:**  We know (x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))(y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1)) \u2265 1.  Substitute this into the inequality from step 4:\n\n   1/4 \u2265 \u221a(x * y * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1) * \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))\n\n6. **Square Both Sides:** Square both sides to get rid of the square root:\n\n   1/16 \u2265 x * y * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1) * \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1)\n\n7. **Minimize x + y:** Our goal is to minimize x + y.  Notice that the right side of the inequality is always non-negative.  To minimize x + y, we want to make the right side as small as possible. This occurs when x * y is as small as possible.\n\n8. **AM-GM Again:** Apply AM-GM to x and y:\n\n   (x + y)/2 \u2265 \u221a(x * y)\n\n9. **Solve for x * y:**  Solving for x * y, we get:\n\n   x * y \u2264 (x + y)\u00b2 / 4\n\n10. **Substitute and Solve:** Substitute this back into the inequality from step 6:\n\n   1/16 \u2265 [(x + y)\u00b2 / 4] * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1) * \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1)\n\n   Simplify and solve for (x + y)\u00b2.

      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Inequality:**  We're given the inequality  \\((x+\\sqrt{x^{2}+1})(y+\\sqrt{y^{2}+1}) \\ge 1\\).  Notice that both terms inside the parentheses are always greater than or equal to zero.\n\n2. **AM-GM Inequality:**  We can use the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, which states that for non-negative numbers a and b:\n   (a + b)/2 \u2265 \u221a(ab)\n\n3. **Applying AM-GM:** Applying AM-GM to the terms inside the parentheses:\n   * (x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))/2 \u2265 \u221a(x * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))\n   * (y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))/2 \u2265 \u221a(y * \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))\n\n4. **Multiplying the Inequalities:** Multiplying the inequalities from step 3, we get:\n   [(x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))/2] * [(y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))/2] \u2265 \u221a(x * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1)) * \u221a(y * \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))\n\n5. **Simplifying:** This simplifies to:\n   (x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))(y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))/4 \u2265 \u221a(xy\u221a(x\u00b2 + 1)\u221a(y\u00b2 + 1))\n\n6. **Minimum Value:** Since the right-hand side is always non-negative, the left-hand side must also be greater than or equal to 1.  Therefore:\n   (x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))(y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1)) \u2265 4\n\n7. **Finding the Minimum:** To minimize x + y, we need to minimize the product (x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 1))(y + \u221a(y\u00b2 + 1)).  This occurs when x and y are as small as possible while still satisfying the inequality.\n\n8. **Conclusion:** While finding the exact minimum value of x + y analytically can be challenging, we know that it must be greater than or equal to a certain value based on the inequality.  Further analysis and potentially numerical methods might be needed to determine the precise minimum.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Analyze the inequality:** We have  \\((x+\\sqrt{x^{2}+1})(y+\\sqrt{y^{2}+1}) \\ge 1\\).  Notice that both terms on the left-hand side are positive. This is because:\n    * \\(x^2 \\ge 0\\) for all real numbers *x*, so \\(x^2 + 1 \\ge 1\\), and  \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\\) is always positive.\n    *  Similarly, \\(y^2 \\ge 0\\) for all real numbers *y*, so \\(y^2 + 1 \\ge 1\\) and \\(\\sqrt{y^2 + 1}\\) is always positive.\n\n2. **Use AM-GM inequality:**  The Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality states that for non-negative numbers *a* and *b*,  \\(\\frac{a+b}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{ab}\\).  \n\n3. **Apply AM-GM to the inequality:** Let's apply AM-GM to the terms inside the parentheses:\n    * \\(\\frac{x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{x \\cdot \\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\\)\n    * \\(\\frac{y + \\sqrt{y^2 + 1}}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{y \\cdot \\sqrt{y^2 + 1}}\\)\n\n4. **Multiply the inequalities:**  Multiplying these inequalities, we get:\n    * \\(\\left(\\frac{x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{y + \\sqrt{y^2 + 1}}{2}\\right) \\ge \\sqrt{x \\cdot \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} \\cdot y \\cdot \\sqrt{y^2 + 1}}\\)\n\n5. **Simplify and compare:**  This simplifies to:\n    * \\(\\frac{(x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1})(y + \\sqrt{y^2 + 1})}{4} \\ge \\sqrt{xy\\sqrt{(x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1)}}\\)\n\n    Since we know \\((x + \\sqrt{x^2 + 1})(y + \\sqrt{y^2 + 1}) \\ge 1\\), we have:\n    * \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\ge \\sqrt{xy\\sqrt{(x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1)}}\\)\n\n6. **Minimize x + y:** To minimize \\(x + y\\), we need to minimize the right-hand side of the inequality.

We can apply this to the terms:\n   *  x\u00b2y\u00b2 + x\u00b2y\u00b2 \u2265 2\u221a(x\u00b2y\u00b2 * x\u00b2y\u00b2) = 2x\u2074y\u2074\n   *  x\u00b2z\u00b2 + x\u00b2z\u00b2 \u2265 2\u221a(x\u00b2z\u00b2 * x\u00b2z\u00b2) = 2x\u2074z\u2074\n   *  y\u00b2z\u00b2 + y\u00b2z\u00b2 \u2265 2\u221a(y\u00b2z\u00b2 * y\u00b2z\u00b2) = 2y\u2074z\u2074\n\n5. **Substitute and simplify:**\n   Substitute the AM-GM results back into the inequality:\n   (1-n)x\u2074 + (1-n)y\u2074 + (1-n)z\u2074 + 2x\u2074y\u2074 + 2x\u2074z\u2074 + 2y\u2074z\u2074 \u2264 0\n\n6. **Analyze for all real values:**\n   For the inequality to hold for *all* real values of x, y, and z, the coefficients of x\u2074, y\u2074, and z\u2074 must be non-positive.

This suggests that we might be able to find a value of *n* that works by considering the maximum possible value of the left side.\n\n4. **Maximize the left side:**\n   To maximize the left side, we want to make the cross-product terms (2x\u00b2y\u00b2, 2x\u00b2z\u00b2, 2y\u00b2z\u00b2) as large as possible.  We can achieve this by setting x = y = z = 1. \n\n5. **Substitute and solve:**\n   Substituting x = y = z = 1 into the left side of the inequality, we get:\n\n   1\u2074 + 2(1\u00b2)(1\u00b2) + 2(1\u00b2)(1\u00b2) + 2(1\u00b2)(1\u00b2) + 1\u2074 + 1\u2074 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 9\n\n   Therefore, we need to find the smallest *n* such that:\n   9 \u2264 n(1\u2074 + 1\u2074 + 1\u2074)\n   9 \u2264 3n\n   3 \u2264 n\n\n6. **The smallest natural number:**\n   The smallest natural number *n* that satisfies this inequality is **n = 3**.\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{3}"

Recall the double angle formulas:\n   * sin 2\u03b1 = 2 sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1 = 2 (\u221a15 / 4) (-1/4) = -\u221a15 / 8\n   * cos 2\u03b1 = cos\u00b2\u03b1 - sin\u00b2\u03b1 = (1/16) - (15/16) = -7/8\n\n5. **Substituting into the Expression:** Now substitute the values we found into the original expression:\n   * [sin(\u03b1 + \u03c0/4)] / (sin 2\u03b1 + cos 2\u03b1 + 1) \n   * = [(\u221a30 / 8) - (\u221a2 / 8)] / (-\u221a15 / 8 - 7/8 + 1)\n   * = [(\u221a30 - \u221a2) / 8] / [(1 - \u221a15 - 7) / 8]\n   * = (\u221a30 - \u221a2) / (1 - \u221a15 - 7)\n\n6. **Simplifying:**\n   * = (\u221a30 - \u221a2) / (-6 - \u221a15)\n\n7. **Rationalizing the Denominator (optional):** You can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to get rid of the radical in the denominator. However, this is not strictly necessary.\n\n\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{30} - \\sqrt{2}}{-6 - \\sqrt{15}}}"

We need to find the value of the fifth house number in this sequence.\n\n2. **Represent the Sequence:**  Let's represent the house numbers as a sequence: a, a+d, a+2d, ..., where 'a' is the house number of the first house and 'd' is the common difference between consecutive house numbers.\n\n3. **Use the Sum Formula:** The sum of an arithmetic series (like our house numbers) is given by: Sum = (n/2) * [2a + (n-1)d], where 'n' is the total number of houses.\n\n4. **Apply the Given Information:** We know the sum is 117 and we need to find the fifth house (n=5).  We don't know 'a' or 'd' yet.\n\n5. **Simplify and Solve:**  We can plug the values into the formula and try to solve for 'a' and 'd'. However, we only need to find the fifth house number, which is a + 4d. We can express this in terms of the sum and the number of houses.\n\nUnfortunately, without more information (like the difference between house numbers or the house number of a specific house), we cannot determine the exact house number of the fifth house. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other details about the problem! \n",

We don't know the first term or the common difference, so let's use variables:  \n   *  a = the first house number\n   *  d = the common difference between house numbers\n\n2. **Set up the equation:** The sum of an arithmetic series is given by: S = (n/2)(a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.

Substituting these into the sum might seem complicated, but it will allow us to express the sum in terms of the $S_n$ values.\n\n5. **Further analysis:**  At this point, you'll likely need to continue simplifying the expression and look for patterns or relationships between the terms.

Substitute c back into Equation 2:**\n\nNow that we know c = -5, we can substitute it back into the original second equation:\n\n-5x - 3y = -2\n\n**5. Use Yi's Solution:**\n\nYi's incorrect solution (x = 2, y = -6) can also be used to form an equation. Substitute these values into the equation from step 4:\n\n-5(2) - 3(-6) = -2\n\n**6. Solve for a and b:**\n\nSimplify the equation from step 5:\n\n-10 + 18 = -2\n8 = -2  (This is a contradiction!)\n\n**7. Analyze the Contradiction:**\n\nThe contradiction we reached (8 = -2) indicates that there is no possible combination of a, b, and c that would lead to both Jia's correct solution and Yi's incorrect solution. This suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement itself. \n\n\n"

      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount invested in each bond:** \n   - Shawn invested half his savings in the simple interest bond, so he invested $2750 / 2 = $1375 in the simple interest bond.\n   - He invested the other half in the compound interest bond, also investing $1375.\n\n2. **Calculate the interest rate:**\n   - We know the simple interest bond earned $550 in interest over 2 years.\n   - Simple interest is calculated as: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time\n   - Therefore, $550 = $1375 * Rate * 2\n   - Solving for Rate: Rate = $550 / ($1375 * 2) = 0.2 or 20% per year.\n\n3. **Calculate the interest earned from the compound interest bond:**\n   - The compound interest formula is: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n     - A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest\n     - P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)\n     - r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\n     - n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year\n     - t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for\n   - In this case, P = $1375, r = 0.20, n = 1 (compounded annually), and t = 2 years.\n   - Plugging these values into the formula: A = $1375 (1 + 0.20/1)^(1*2) = $1375 * (1.20)^2 = $1375 * 1.44 = $1992\n   - The interest earned is the difference between the future value and the principal: $1992 - $1375 = $617.\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{$617}",
      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount invested in each bond:** Since Shawn invested half his savings in each bond, he invested $2750 / 2 = $1375 in each bond.\n\n2. **Calculate the interest rate:**  Let 'r' be the interest rate. The simple interest earned from the first bond is $1375 * r * 2 = $2750r$. We know this interest is $550, so $2750r = $550.  Solving for 'r', we get r = $550 / $2750 = 0.2 or 20%.\n\n3. **Calculate the amount in the compound interest bond after 2 years:** The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.  \n\n   In this case, P = $1375, r = 0.2, n = 1 (compounded annually), and t = 2.  Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n   A = $1375(1 + 0.2/1)^(1*2) = $1375(1.2)^2 = $1375 * 1.44 = $1992\n\n4. **Calculate the compound interest earned:** The compound interest earned is the difference between the final amount and the principal: $1992 - $1375 = $617.\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{$617}"

      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Recognize the symmetry:** Notice that both sine and cosine functions have a period of $2\\pi$.  This means that  \n   * $\\sin(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta + 2\\pi)$ and\n   * $\\cos(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta + 2\\pi)$\n\n2. **Apply the symmetry:**  Let's focus on the argument of the cosine function: $\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\sin x$.  We can rewrite the equation as:\n   $$\\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}2 \\cos x\\right) = \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x + 2\\pi \\right)$$\n\n3. **Simplify using periodicity:** Since cosine has a period of $2\\pi$, we can simplify further:\n   $$\\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}2 \\cos x\\right) = \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x \\right)$$\n\n4. **Consider the unit circle:**  Recall that the sine and cosine functions represent the y and x coordinates, respectively, on the unit circle.  The equation $\\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}2 \\cos x\\right) = \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x \\right)$ means that the y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle determined by $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos x$ is equal to the x-coordinate of a point determined by $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x$.\n\n5. **Visualize and count solutions:**  Due to the symmetry of the unit circle and the nature of sine and cosine, there will be multiple solutions in the interval $[0, \\pi]$.  You can visualize this by plotting the graphs of $y = \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}2 \\cos x\\right)$ and $y = \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x \\right)$ on the interval $[0, \\pi]$ to count the points of intersection. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these steps or help you with the visualization! \n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Recognize the Trigonometric Identities:**  Notice that the equation involves compositions of trigonometric functions.  We might be able to simplify it using trigonometric identities.\n\n2. **Consider the Unit Circle:**  Think about the unit circle and the values of sine and cosine at different angles. This can help us visualize the solutions.\n\n3. **Simplify Using the Angle Addition Formula:**  Recall the angle addition formula for cosine:\n   cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B\n\n4. **Apply the Formula:**  Let's try to rewrite the right side of the equation using the angle addition formula.  We can rewrite:\n\n   cos(\u03c0/2 sin x) = cos(\u03c0/2) cos(x) + sin(\u03c0/2) sin(x)\n\n5. **Simplify Further:**  Since cos(\u03c0/2) = 0 and sin(\u03c0/2) = 1, we get:\n\n   cos(\u03c0/2 sin x) = sin(x)\n\n6. **Substitute and Solve:** Now our equation becomes:\n\n   sin(\u03c0/2 cos x) = sin(x)\n\n   To solve this, we need to find the angles x in the interval [0, \u03c0] where the sine function takes on the same value for both arguments.\n\n7. **Analyze the Solutions:** Consider the following:\n   *  The sine function has a period of 2\u03c0.\n   *  The sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants.\n   *  We need to find solutions within the interval [0, \u03c0].\n\n8. **Count the Solutions:**  By carefully analyzing the sine function and considering the given interval, you'll find a specific number of solutions.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to work through the specific angle analysis to find the exact number of solutions! \n"

We need to find the magnitude of their difference, $|z_1 - z_2|$.\n\n2. **Using the Magnitude Property:**  Recall that the magnitude of a complex number is related to its real and imaginary parts. For a complex number  *w* = *a* + *bi*,  we have |*w*| = \u221a(*a*\u00b2 + *b*\u00b2).\n\n3. **Applying the Triangle Inequality:** The triangle inequality states that for any complex numbers *u* and *v*, |*u* + *v*| \u2264 |*u*| + |*v*|.  In our case, we know |*z*\u2081| = 1, |*z*\u2082| = 1, and |*z*\u2081 + *z*\u2082| = \u221a3.  Therefore, \u221a3 \u2264 1 + 1, which simplifies to \u221a3 \u2264 2.

Substituting these values into the triangle inequality, we get:\n\n   \u221a3 \u2264 1 + 1\n   \u221a3 \u2264 2\n\n4. **Equality Case:**  The triangle inequality becomes an equality when the three points representing the complex numbers are collinear (lie on the same line).

Substituting these values into the law of cosines, we get:\n\n   |z\u2081 - z\u2082|\u00b2 = 1 + 1 - 2 * cos(\u03b8)\n\n8. **Finding cos(\u03b8):** We can find cos(\u03b8) using the given information |z\u2081 + z\u2082| = \u221a3.  \n\n   |z\u2081 + z\u2082|\u00b2 = (z\u2081 + z\u2082)(z\u2081* + z\u2082*) = |z\u2081|\u00b2 + |z\u2082|\u00b2 + z\u2081 * z\u2082* + z\u2081* * z\u2082 \n   \u221a3\u00b2 = 1 + 1 + z\u2081 * z\u2082* + z\u2081* * z\u2082\n   3 = 2 + z\u2081 * z\u2082* + z\u2081* * z\u2082\n\n   Since |z\u2081| = |z\u2082| = 1,  z\u2081 * z\u2082* is the product of the complex numbers, which is also a complex number.  Therefore, the real part of z\u2081 * z\u2082* + z\u2081* * z\u2082 is equal to cos(\u03b8).\n\n   So, cos(\u03b8) = (3 - 2) / 2 = 1/2\n\n9. **Calculating |z\u2081 - z\u2082|:**  Substituting cos(\u03b8) = 1/2 back into the equation from step 7, we get:\n\n   |z\u2081 - z\u2082|\u00b2 = 1 + 1 - 2 * (1/2) = 1\n\n10. **Final Answer:** Taking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n   |z\u2081 - z\u2082| = \\boxed{1}\n\n\n\n",
