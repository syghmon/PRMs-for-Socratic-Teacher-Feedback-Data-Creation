A line parallel to the bases divides it into two smaller trapezoids.  \n\n2. **Inscribed Circles:**  Since each smaller trapezoid has an inscribed circle, the perpendicular distances from the vertices of each trapezoid to the line parallel to the bases are equal.

Applying the Dot Product Formula**\n\n*  If P lies on side AB,  $\\overrightarrow{PA}$ and $\\overrightarrow{PB}$ will have the same direction. The angle $\\theta$ will be 0 degrees, and  $\\cos 0 = 1$.\n\n* The magnitudes $|\\overrightarrow{PA}|$ and $|\\overrightarrow{PB}|$ will depend on the specific location of P on side AB. \n\n**6. Finding the Minimum**\n\nTo find the exact minimum value, we'd need to consider the different positions of P on AB and calculate the dot product for each. However, we know the dot product will be maximized when P is on AB. \n\n\n\n**Answer:** The minimum value of $\\overrightarrow{PA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{PB}$ occurs when point P lies on side AB of the triangle.  To find the exact minimum value, further calculations are needed. \n",

Geometric Interpretation**\n\n*  This means the vectors $\\overset{\u2192}{PA}$ and $\\overset{\u2192}{PB}$ should be pointing in opposite directions for the dot product to be minimized.\n\n*  This happens when point $P$ is located on the extension of a side of the triangle, such that  $\\overrightarrow{PA}$ and $\\overrightarrow{PB}$ are antiparallel.\n\n**5. Finding the Minimum Value**\n\n*  Without specific information about the triangle's angles, we can't determine the exact magnitude of  $\\overrightarrow{PA}$ and $\\overrightarrow{PB}$. \n*  However, we know the minimum value of the dot product is achieved when  $\\cos \\theta = -1$.\n\n*  Therefore, the minimum value of  $\\overset{\u2192}{PA} \\cdot \\overset{\u2192}{PB}$ is: \n    \n    $\\boxed{-||\\overset{\u2192}{PA}|| ||\\overset{\u2192}{PB}||}$\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore a specific case where we know the triangle's angles!\n",

Since the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is positive, the parabola opens upwards, meaning the minimum value occurs at the endpoints of our interval. \n   *  Evaluate the expression at *x* = 2:  $2^2 - 2(2) = 0$\n   *  Evaluate the expression at *x* = 4:  $4^2 - 2(4) = 8$\n\n4. **Determine the range of *m*:**\n\n   *  For the inequality to hold for some *x* in [2, 4], the expression $x^2 - 2x$ must be less than *m* + 2. \n   *  Since the minimum value of $x^2 - 2x$ within [2, 4] is 0, we have:  $0 < m + 2$\n   *  Therefore, $m > -2$.\n\n   * The maximum value of $x^2 - 2x$ within [2, 4] is 8. So, we also have: $8 < m + 2$\n   *  Therefore, $m > 6$.\n\n5. **Combine the results:**  We need *m* to satisfy both conditions: *m* > -2 and *m* > 6. The solution that satisfies both is *m* > 6.\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{m > 6}"

      "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** We know the sum of all house numbers on one side of the street is 117. We need to find the house number of the fifth house.\n\n2. **Thinking about the Pattern:**  House numbers typically increase consecutively (1, 2, 3, ...). This means there's a pattern we can use.\n\n3. **Using the Arithmetic Series Formula:** The sum of an arithmetic series (like consecutive house numbers) is found with the formula:\n\n   Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)\n\n   where 'n' is the number of terms.\n\n4. **Applying the Formula:**  We don't know the last house number, but we can represent it. Let the first house number be 'a' and the last house number be 'l'. We know:\n\n   * n (number of houses) =  unknown\n   * Sum = 117\n   * a = 1 (the first house number is always 1)\n\n5. **Finding the Fifth House:** To find the fifth house number, we need to figure out the pattern. Since the sum is 117, we can try different values for 'l' and 'n' that satisfy the formula.  \n\n6. **Trial and Error:**  Without more information, it's impossible to determine the exact house number of the fifth house. We would need more clues about the street's layout or the distribution of house numbers.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other information about the street! \n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Assume a pattern:** Since the house numbers are consecutive, let's assume the first house number is 'x'.\n\n2. **Represent the sum:** The sum of the house numbers from the first to the nth house is given by the formula: n(x + x + (n-1)d), where 'd' is the difference between consecutive house numbers (which is 1 in this case).\n\n3. **Apply the information:** We know the sum is 117 and there are 'n' houses (we need to find 'n' to get the 5th house number). So, n(x + x + (n-1)1) = 117\n\n4. **Simplify the equation:** n(2x + n - 1) = 117\n\n5. **Find 'n':**  We need to find the value of 'n' that satisfies this equation. Since we are looking for the 5th house, n = 5.\n\n6. **Substitute and solve:** Substitute n = 5 into the equation: 5(2x + 5 - 1) = 117\n   - Simplify: 5(2x + 4) = 117\n   - Further simplification: 10x + 20 = 117\n   - Subtract 20 from both sides: 10x = 97\n   - Divide both sides by 10: x = 9.7\n\n7. **Find the 5th house number:** The 5th house number is x + 4 = 9.7 + 4 = 13.7\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{13.7} \n",

      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the problem:** We have a street with house numbers adding up to 117. We need to find the house number of the fifth house. \n\n2. **Represent the unknowns:** Let's say the first house number is 'a'.  Since the houses are consecutive, the house numbers form an arithmetic sequence: a, a+1, a+2, ...,\n\n3. **Use the sum formula:** The sum of an arithmetic series is (n/2)(first term + last term), where 'n' is the number of terms.

      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Complete the square:**  We want to manipulate the given equation to make it easier to work with.  Notice that the terms involving *a* and *b* suggest completing the square. \n\n   *  Group the *a* terms and the *b* terms:  \n      (9a\u00b2 - 6a) + (b\u00b2 - 2b) = 0\n\n   *  Factor out coefficients from each group:\n      9(a\u00b2 - (2/3)a) + (b\u00b2 - 2b) = 0\n\n   *  To complete the square for the *a* terms, take half of the coefficient of our *a* term (-2/3), square it ((-1/3)\u00b2 = 1/9), and add it inside the parentheses. Since we're adding it inside parentheses that are being multiplied by 9, we need to add 9*(1/9) = 1 to the right side of the equation to keep it balanced.\n\n      9(a\u00b2 - (2/3)a + 1/9) + (b\u00b2 - 2b) = 1\n\n   *  Do the same for the *b* terms. Half of -2 is -1, and squaring it gives us 1. Add and subtract 1 on the right side:\n      9(a\u00b2 - (2/3)a + 1/9) + (b\u00b2 - 2b + 1 - 1) = 1\n\n   * Now we can rewrite the expressions in parentheses as squared terms:\n      9(a - 1/3)\u00b2 + (b - 1)\u00b2 - 1 = 1\n\n   *  Simplify:\n      9(a - 1/3)\u00b2 + (b - 1)\u00b2 = 2\n\n2. **Recognize the form:** The equation 9(a - 1/3)\u00b2 + (b - 1)\u00b2 = 2  represents an ellipse centered at (1/3, 1).\n\n3. **Maximize 3a + b:**  The maximum value of 3a + b occurs at the point on the ellipse that is farthest along the line defined by 3a + b.  \n\n   *  Think of this problem geometrically. The line 3a + b represents a direction.

Focus on the terms involving *a* and *b* separately.\n\n   *  For the *a* terms:  $9a^2 - 6a = 9(a^2 - \\frac{2}{3}a)$.  To complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of the coefficient of our *a* term (-2/3), square it ((-1/3)^2 = 1/9), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses: \n      $9(a^2 - \\frac{2}{3}a + \\frac{1}{9} - \\frac{1}{9}) = 9(a - \\frac{1}{3})^2 - 1$\n\n   * For the *b* terms: $b^2 - 2b = b^2 - 2b + 1 - 1 = (b-1)^2 - 1$\n\n2. **Rewrite the equation:** Substitute the completed square expressions back into the original equation:\n   $9(a - \\frac{1}{3})^2 - 1 + (b-1)^2 - 1 = 0$\n\n3. **Simplify:** Combine the constants and rearrange:\n   $9(a - \\frac{1}{3})^2 + (b-1)^2 = 2$\n\n4. **Interpret as a circle:** This equation represents a circle centered at (1/3, 1) with a radius of $\\sqrt{2/9}$.\n\n5. **Maximize 3a + b:**  We want to find the maximum value of $3a+b$.  Notice that the equation of the circle tells us that the points $(a,b)$ that satisfy the equation lie on the circle.  The maximum value of $3a+b$ will occur at the point on the circle that is farthest from the line $3a+b=0$.\n\n6. **Geometric Insight:**  The line $3a+b=0$ is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting the center of the circle (1/3, 1) and the point where the circle intersects the line $3a+b=0$.  Therefore, the maximum value of $3a+b$ occurs at the point on the circle that is farthest from the center.\n\n7. **Find the farthest point:**  Since the circle is centered at (1/3, 1), the farthest point on the circle from the center will lie along the diameter that passes through the center. This diameter will have a slope of -3 (the negative reciprocal of 1/3).\n\n8. **Calculate the coordinates:**  We can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the diameter:\n   *  Slope: -3\n   *  Point: (1/3, 1)\n   *  Equation: $y - 1 = -3(x - \\frac{1}{3})$\n   *  Simplify: $y = -3x + 2$\n\n   To find the point on this diameter that lies on the circle, we can substitute the equation of the diameter into the equation of the circle:\n\n   $9(a - \\frac{1}{3})^2 + (-3a + 2 - 1)^2 = 2$\n   $9(a - \\frac{1}{3})^2 + (-3a + 1)^2 = 2$\n\n   Solve for *a* and substitute it back into the equation of the diameter to find *b*. This will give you the coordinates of the point on the circle that maximizes $3a+b$.\n\n9. **Find the maximum value:**  Finally, substitute the coordinates of the point you found into the expression $3a+b$ to find the maximum value.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to work through the detailed algebra steps for finding the coordinates and the maximum value. \n",

Since we're adding it inside parentheses that are being multiplied by 9, we need to add 9*(1/9) = 1 to the right side of the equation to keep it balanced: \n      9(a\u00b2 - (2/3)a + 1/9) + b\u00b2 - 2b = 1\n   *  Rewrite the expression in parentheses as a squared term: 9(a - 1/3)\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2b = 1\n   *  Repeat the process for the 'b' terms:  \n      9(a - 1/3)\u00b2 + (b\u00b2 - 2b + 1) = 1 + 1\n   *  Rewrite the 'b' terms as a squared term: 9(a - 1/3)\u00b2 + (b - 1)\u00b2 = 2\n\n2. **Use the equation to find the maximum value:** Now our equation is in the form: 9(a - 1/3)\u00b2 + (b - 1)\u00b2 = 2\n\n   *  This equation represents an ellipse centered at (1/3, 1).\n   *  The maximum value of 3a + b occurs when the point (a, b) is at the farthest point from the origin along the line 3a + b = k (where k is a constant).\n\n3. **Maximize 3a + b:**  To maximize 3a + b, we need to consider the geometry of the ellipse. The farthest point on the ellipse from the origin will lie on the major axis of the ellipse.  The major axis is the longest diameter of the ellipse.\n\n   *  The major axis of this ellipse is determined by the larger of the two coefficients in front of the squared terms (9 and 1). \n   *  Since 9 is larger, the major axis is along the a-direction. \n\n4. **Final Steps:**\n   *  The maximum value of 3a + b will occur when (a, b) is on the major axis, and the 'a' term is maximized.\n   *  Due to the form of the equation, the maximum value of (a - 1/3)\u00b2 will be 2/9.\n   *  Therefore, the maximum value of 'a' will be 1/3 + \u221a(2/9) = 1/3 + \u221a2/3.\n   *  Substitute this value of 'a' back into 3a + b to find the maximum value of 3a + b.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to work through the calculation for the maximum value of 3a + b. \n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Complete the square:**  We want to rewrite the given equation in a way that makes it easier to work with.  Notice that the first two terms and the last two terms resemble the patterns for completing the square. \n\n   * For the terms involving *a*,  factor out a 9: \n     9(a\u00b2 - (2/3)a) + b\u00b2 - 2b = 0\n\n   * To complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of the coefficient of our *a* term (-2/3), square it ((-1/3)\u00b2 = 1/9), and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:\n     9(a\u00b2 - (2/3)a + 1/9 - 1/9) + b\u00b2 - 2b = 0\n\n   *  Do the same for the terms involving *b*:\n     9(a\u00b2 - (2/3)a + 1/9 - 1/9) + (b\u00b2 - 2b + 1 - 1) = 0\n\n2. **Rewrite as squared terms:** Now we can rewrite the expressions in parentheses as squared terms:\n     9(a - 1/3)\u00b2 - 9(1/9) + (b - 1)\u00b2 - 1 = 0\n\n3. **Simplify:** Combine the constants:\n     9(a - 1/3)\u00b2 + (b - 1)\u00b2 - 2 = 0\n\n4. **Isolate the squared terms:** Add 2 to both sides:\n     9(a - 1/3)\u00b2 + (b - 1)\u00b2 = 2\n\n5. **Interpret the equation:** This equation represents an ellipse centered at (1/3, 1) with a semi-major axis of \u221a(2/9) and a semi-minor axis of \u221a2.\n\n6. **Maximize 3a + b:**  Since the ellipse is centered at (1/3, 1), the maximum value of 3a + b will occur at the point on the ellipse farthest along the line defined by 3a + b.  This point will lie on the major axis of the ellipse.  We can find the equation of the major axis and then find the point on it that maximizes 3a + b.  However, this is a bit more involved and may not be necessary depending on the specific requirements of the problem.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to work through the maximization of 3a + b in more detail!\n"

      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Recognize the AM-GM Inequality:** This problem involves the sum of positive numbers, suggesting we might use the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean.\n\n2. **Apply AM-GM:**  Let's apply AM-GM to the first two terms:\n   *  \n     \n     $\\frac{\\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y}}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{x} \\cdot \\frac{108}{y}}$\n\n   * Simplifying: \n     \n     $\\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} \\ge 2\\sqrt{\\frac{16 \\cdot 108}{xy}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{1728}{xy}}$\n\n3. **Combine with xy:**  Now we have:\n\n   * $\\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy \\ge 2\\sqrt{\\frac{1728}{xy}} + xy$\n\n4. **Another AM-GM:** Apply AM-GM to the last two terms:\n\n   * $\\sqrt{\\frac{1728}{xy}} + \\sqrt{xy} \\ge 2\\sqrt{\\sqrt{\\frac{1728}{xy}} \\cdot \\sqrt{xy}}$\n\n   * Simplifying: $\\sqrt{\\frac{1728}{xy}} + \\sqrt{xy} \\ge 2\\sqrt{1728^{1/2}}$\n\n5. **Substitute and Simplify:** Substitute the result from step 4 back into the inequality from step 3:\n\n   * $\\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy \\ge 2(2\\sqrt{1728}) + xy = 4\\sqrt{1728} + xy$\n\n6. **Minimize:** To minimize the expression, we need to minimize  *xy*. Since *x* and *y* are positive, their product will be smallest when they are as close to each other as possible.  We can use the fact that the product of two numbers is minimized when they are equal.\n\n7. **Equality Condition:** To achieve equality in the AM-GM inequalities, we need:\n\n   * $\\frac{16}{x} = \\frac{108}{y}$  \n   * $\\sqrt{\\frac{1728}{xy}} = \\sqrt{xy}$\n\n   Solving these equations, we find *x* = *y* = 12.\n\n8. **Final Calculation:** Substitute *x* = *y* = 12 into the minimized expression:\n\n   * $\\frac{16}{12} + \\frac{108}{12} + 12 \\cdot 12 = \\frac{4}{3} + 9 + 144 = \\boxed{\\frac{443}{3}}$ \n\n\n\n",

Applying AM-GM, we have:\n     \n     $\\frac{\\frac{16}{x} + xy}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{x} \\cdot xy} = \\sqrt{16y} = 4\\sqrt{y}$\n\n   * Similarly, for the terms $\\frac{108}{y}$ and $xy$, we get:\n\n     $\\frac{\\frac{108}{y} + xy}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{\\frac{108}{y} \\cdot xy} = \\sqrt{108x} = 6\\sqrt{3x}$\n\n3. **Combine the Inequalities:**\n\n   Adding the two inequalities from step 2, we have:\n\n   $\\frac{\\frac{16}{x} + xy}{2} + \\frac{\\frac{108}{y} + xy}{2} \\ge 4\\sqrt{y} + 6\\sqrt{3x}$\n\n   Simplifying:\n\n   $\\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + 2xy \\ge 8\\sqrt{y} + 12\\sqrt{3x}$\n\n4. **Isolate the Desired Expression:**\n\n   Finally, subtract $2xy$ from both sides to get the expression we want:\n\n   $\\frac{16}{x} + \\frac{108}{y} + xy \\ge 8\\sqrt{y} + 12\\sqrt{3x} - xy$\n\n5. **Minimize the Expression:**\n\n   To minimize the expression on the right-hand side, we need to minimize $8\\sqrt{y}$ and $12\\sqrt{3x}$.

This means that *g(x)* can take on any value for any *x* in its domain. \n\n\n**Therefore, the range of the function *y = g(x)* on the interval [1, 2] is  \\boxed{[1, 2]}.**\n",
      "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Inverse:** The inverse function,  *g(x)*, \"undoes\" what the original function *f(x)* does.  This means if *f(a) = b*, then *g(b) = a*.\n\n2. **Find the Domain and Range of f(x):**\n   * The domain of *f(x) = log<sub>(1/2)</sub>x* is all positive real numbers (x > 0) because you can't take the logarithm of zero or a negative number.\n   * The range of *f(x)* is all real numbers.  Logarithmic functions can output any real number.\n\n3. **Relate Domain and Range:**  The domain of *f(x)* becomes the range of *g(x)*, and vice versa.\n\n4. **Consider the Interval:** We're interested in the range of *g(x)* on the interval [1, 2]. This means we need to find the values of *x* for which *g(x)* falls within this interval.\n\n5. **Work Backwards:** Since we know the domain of *f(x)* is all positive real numbers,  we need to find the values of *x* in the interval [1, 2] that correspond to the outputs of *f(x)*. \n\n6. **Analyze the Logarithm:**  Remember that *log<sub>(1/2)</sub>x* gives you the power to which you must raise (1/2) to get *x*.  Since (1/2) is less than 1, the logarithm will be negative for values of *x* greater than 1.  \n\n7. **Determine the Range:**  Therefore, the range of *g(x)* on the interval [1, 2] is **(-\u221e, 0]**.\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{(-\u221e, 0]}"

The Law of Cosines relates the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles: \n   *  c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\n2. **Substitute the known values:** We are given a = 4, b = 3, and c = 2. Let's substitute these values into the formula:\n   * 2\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 - 2 * 4 * 3 * cos(C)\n\n3. **Solve for cos(C):**\n   * 4 = 16 + 9 - 24 * cos(C)\n   * 4 = 25 - 24 * cos(C)\n   * -21 = -24 * cos(C)\n   * cos(C) = 21/24 = 7/8\n\n4. **Find the inverse cosine:** To find angle C, we'll take the inverse cosine (arccos) of both sides:\n   * C = arccos(7/8)\n\n   This gives us the angle C.  Since we want the *smallest* angle, and we've used the Law of Cosines, this will be the angle opposite the shortest side (c = 2).\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{C = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{7}{8}\\right)}"

      "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Let 'x' be the original price of gasoline.**  \n\n2. **Let 'y' be the percentage increase in the price of gasoline.**\n\n3. **The new price of gasoline is x + 0.01x = 1.01x** (a percentage increase of 'y' is represented as 0.01y, and we add it to the original price).\n\n4. **The driver wants to spend 10% more on gasoline, so their new spending is 1.10 times their original spending.**\n\n5. **Since the driver wants to buy less gasoline, let's represent the new quantity as 0.88 times the original quantity (because they are reducing it by 12%).**\n\n6. **We can set up an equation based on the relationship between price, quantity, and spending:**\n   * Original spending = Original price * Original quantity\n   * New spending = New price * New quantity\n\n7. **Substituting our values:**\n   *  x * quantity = Original spending\n   *  1.10 * x * quantity = 1.01x * 0.88 * quantity\n\n8. **Simplifying the equation:**\n   *  1.10x * quantity = 0.8888x * quantity\n\n9. **Dividing both sides by 'quantity' and 'x' to isolate 'y':**\n   * 1.10 = 0.8888 + 0.01y\n\n10. **Solving for 'y':**\n    * 0.2112 = 0.01y\n    * y = 21.12%\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{21.12\\%}",
      "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Let's represent the original price of gasoline as 100.**  This makes the calculations easier to follow.\n\n2. **Let 'x' be the percentage increase in the price of gasoline.**  \n\n3. **The new price of gasoline would be 100 + x%** \n\n4. **The driver wants to spend 10% more on gasoline, so if the original amount spent was $100, the new amount spent would be $110.**\n\n5. **To keep the spending at $110, the driver needs to buy less gasoline. They reduce the quantity by 12%, meaning they buy 88% of the original amount.**\n\n6. **We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:**\n   (100 + x) * 0.88 = 110\n\n7. **Solve for x:**\n   * 88 + 0.88x = 110\n   * 0.88x = 22\n   * x = 22 / 0.88\n   * x = 25\n\n\n**Answer: \\boxed{25\\%}** \n \nThe price of gasoline increased by 25%.",

The z-score formula is:\n\n   z = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\n   Where:\n    * x is the raw score\n    * \u03bc is the mean\n    * \u03c3 is the standard deviation (square root of the variance)\n\n3. **Calculate the Z-scores:**\n   * For x = 80: z = (80 - 80) / 10 = 0\n   * For x = 90: z = (90 - 80) / 10 = 1\n\n4. **Find the Area under the Curve:** Using a Z-table or calculator, we find the area under the standard normal curve between z = 0 and z = 1. This area represents the proportion of students who scored between 80 and 90 points.\n\n5. **Interpret the Result:** The area under the curve between z = 0 and z = 1 is approximately 0.3413.\n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{0.3413} or approximately 34.13% of the students.\n",
      "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Normal Distribution:**  We're dealing with a normal distribution, which is a bell-shaped curve. The mean (average) is 80, and the standard deviation is 10.\n\n2. **Z-Scores:** To find the proportion of students within a specific range, we'll use z-scores. A z-score tells us how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean.\n\n   *  Calculate the z-score for 80: z = (80 - 80) / 10 = 0\n   *  Calculate the z-score for 90: z = (90 - 80) / 10 = 1\n\n3. **Standard Normal Table:**  A standard normal table (or z-table) gives us the probability of a z-score being less than a given value. Look up the probabilities for z = 0 and z = 1 in the table.\n\n   *  P(z < 0) = 0.5000 (This is the probability of scoring below the mean)\n   *  P(z < 1) = 0.8413 (This is the probability of scoring below 90)\n\n4. **Find the Difference:**  To get the probability of scoring between 80 and 90, subtract the probability of scoring below 80 from the probability of scoring below 90:\n\n   *  P(80 < x < 90) = P(z < 1) - P(z < 0) = 0.8413 - 0.5000 = 0.3413\n\n5. **Multiply by Class Size:**  Finally, multiply the probability by the class size to find the approximate number of students:\n\n   *  0.3413 * 48 = 16.39\n\n   \n\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{16} (We round to the nearest whole number since we can't have a fraction of a student). \n",
      "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Normal Distribution:**  The problem states that the scores follow a normal distribution, which is a bell-shaped curve. The mean (average) score is 80, and the standard deviation is 10.\n\n2. **Z-Scores:** To find the proportion of students within a certain range, we need to convert the scores (80 and 90) to z-scores. A z-score tells us how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean.\n\n   *  **Z-score for 80:** (80 - 80) / 10 = 0\n   *  **Z-score for 90:** (90 - 80) / 10 = 1\n\n3. **Standard Normal Table:**  We can use a standard normal table (or a calculator) to find the proportion of the distribution that falls within a given z-score range. \n\n   *  Look up the z-score of 0 in the table. This will give you the proportion of scores below 80.\n   *  Look up the z-score of 1 in the table. This will give you the proportion of scores below 90.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference:** Subtract the proportion for z = 0 from the proportion for z = 1. This difference represents the proportion of students who scored between 80 and 90.\n\n5. **Multiply by the Total Number of Students:**  Finally, multiply the proportion you found in step 4 by the total number of students (48) to get the approximate number of students who scored between 80 and 90.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to look up the specific proportions from the standard normal table and calculate the final answer. \n"

This implies $x \\geq 6$ and $x \\geq -1$.  Since both must be true, we take the stricter condition, $x \\geq 6$.\n\n   * Case 2: $x-6 \\leq 0$ and $x+1 \\leq 0$. This implies $x \\leq 6$ and $x \\leq -1$.  Again, taking the stricter condition, we have $x \\leq -1$.\n\n3. **Express set P:**  Therefore, set $P$ contains all real numbers less than or equal to -1 or greater than or equal to 6:\n   $P = \\{x \\mid x \\leq -1 \\text{ or } x \\geq 6\\}$\n\n4. **Find the complement:** The complement of $P$ in $U$ consists of all real numbers that are *not* in $P$. This means the complement includes all real numbers strictly between -1 and 6:\n   $\\complement_U P = \\{x \\mid -1 < x < 6\\}$\n\n\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{\\complement_U P = \\{x \\mid -1 < x < 6\\}}$"
